This trend that started', 'body': 'Tuesday 7 July 2020 10:36 am\\nThe case for decentralized finance\\nCrypto AM Founders Series\\nDiego Gutirrez Zaldvar, Co-Founder &CEO of IOV Labs\\nDecentralised Finance (DeFi) has become a trending topic over the last year in the Blockchain world. This trend that started in the Ethereum ecosystem is now beginning to grow on the RSK Network, its Bitcoin counterpart, and other open Blockchains (Ethereum Classic, EOS and Cardano among others). This new use case promises to turn crypto economies into complete financial systems that can provide a service offering on par with that of traditional finance.\\nAlthough the Decentralised part in DeFi is still an aspirational goal as all existing solutions have at least some level of centralisation, they still have merit on their own. For starters, they inherit, to a certain degree, the openness, transparency, and immutability that Bitcoin inaugurated more than a decade ago. But they go beyond the basic store and transfer of value functionality to provide the ability to handle any digital asset (commodities, stocks, digital versions of local currencies, etc) hosted on the Blockchain using complex financial agreements.\\nThese new capabilities are enabled by Smart Contracts, self-executing business logic that can be attached to any digital asset. Like with any disruptive technology, the first uses replicate existing applications in a new medium. That is how in the early days of the Internet we replicated the postal service in a digital form, giving life to e-mail. We also built e-commerce sites that mimicking the model of physical shops.\\nIn the same way, all these Smart Contract-enabled Blockchain platforms are creating a digital twin of the worlds financial system, a new kind of Internet, the Internet of Value. The foundational layer was brought to us by Bitcoin, a kind of digital gold, a neutral, digital, and global reserve of value that is censorship-resistant and anybody can access. And in the current COVID-19 crisis, Bitcoin offers us one of the few places where people without access to financial markets or physical gold can protect their\\nwealth for the medium to long term.\\nBut storing value longer term is only the prerogative of less than one-third of the world&#8217;s population, and even for that third the implied volatility of a store of value asset is not suitable for their short term economic activity. Maybe that is why the most successful DeFi solution is Stablecoins; these crypto-assets follow the price of the most relevant currencies worldwide, providing a native hedge against volatility. The most successfully adopted stablecoin, USDT, has surpassed Bitcoin in daily traded volume. Its model is very straightforward: for every dollar issued on the Blockchain, there is one dollar to back it up in a bank account. Once again, the decentralization is more of a journey than a fixed objective, and openness of access remains the core attribute of these solutions. Since the launch of USDT, many\\ninteresting alternatives have emerged that proposed a model where cryptocurrency acts as collateral, and the issuance is controlled by a Smart Contract, strongly increasing the level of decentralization. The precursors in this model is MakerDAO, which created the DAI token backed by ether (ETH) on Ethereum, followed by MoneyOnChain that created the first bitcoin (BTC) backed stablecoin on RSK last year, and for sure many more will come.\\nThe interesting thing is that thanks to these Stablecoins, a breadth of open financial services are emerging. While lending and liquidity provision are the most popular applications in the DeFi ecosystem, we are seeing this offering expand at a rapid pace, en route to completing the full range of financial services that exist in our society. The openness, transparency, and progressive disintermediation of DeFi reduces counterparty risk, making financial services cheaper, faster, and more available. But the true value of this ecosystem is composability. The synergies of having all these money legos implemented into a standardized framework can offer a level of innovation and efficiency impossible to achieve in the traditional financial infrastructure. Once a new component (ie: payment gateway with a countrys financial infrastructure) is added, the whole ecosystem benefits from it, speeding up time to market and global expansion exponentially.\\nAll these DeFi applications are already serving the early adopters but as we know, Bitcoiners, Ethereans, and other crypto pioneers account for maybe half a percent of the population, and self-served ecosystems can only grow to a certain point. On the other hand, for people already served by the traditional financial system, this new financial infrastructure offers an incremental value. So a question emerges, where does the true disruption and potential of this nascent ecosystem reside for broader society?\\nThe answer is: Financial Inclusion. Due to its limitations, the traditional financial system leaves billions of people unserved or underserved. Also, its fragility becomes more evident in times of crisis like we are living in right now; Coincidentally enough, Bitcoin was launched amid the 2008 economic crisis and the DeFi ecosystem is being born a pandemic that is triggering an even bigger economic crisis all over the world. In a context where underdeveloped countries and regions will suffer the biggest impact and where their population sees their economic value evaporate due to hyperinflation and bad monetary policies, this new global and inclusive financial infrastructure becomes more relevant than ever.\\nDeFi is what we have been building and chasing since the very beginning of our project and it is at the core of our purpose. We are working on decentralizing the financial system because the true value for people and society is openness and neutrality. In 2012, I used Bitcoin for the first time. I was in Argentina, where we had capital controls. It was impossible to get money in and out and a friend of mine told me, Im so excited about Bitcoin! Why dont you try it out? Open an account on this website (it was blockchain.info). I gave him the address and he sent me a lot of Bitcoins, and after that, I sent the Bitcoins back. We didnt have to ask for permission from anyone, we just did it, and the whole process took an hour. Sending around 5,000 Bitcoin from Silicon Valley to Buenos Aires and back! This is how a truly global and open financial system should work.\\nAt IOV Labs we are extending the Bitcoin financial system to be a fully open financial system through our platforms RSK Smart Contracts, RSK Infrastructure Framework (RIF), and Taringa.\\nWe are living in a moment where the traditional financial system is facing a lot of challenges and, in some places, is collapsing. It is very important to have the tools to offer an alternative, not only relying on centralized technology and systems, but also their decentralized counterparts. The timing is right, we have been working for many years, and the tools are co', 'snippet': '... ecosystem is now beginning to grow on the RSK Network, its <b>Bitcoin</b> counterpart, and other open Blockchains (Ethereum Classic, EOS and Cardano among ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-07-07T09:36:01', 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DGZ_alto-1-scaled.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.cityam.com/the-case-for-decentralized-finance/'}}, {'id': '1958316781659330267', 'title': 'Bitcoin addresses surge as volatility drops to 15-month low', 'url': 'https://www.cityam.com/bitcoin-addresses-surge-as-volatility-drops-to-15-month-low/', 'description': 'This week the price of Bitcoin (BTC) started trading around $9,150 and quickly moved up to $9,250.

The cryptocurrencys price then plummeted again making it clear its range narrowed down from $9,000 to $10,000 to its lower end.\\nEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, started the week trading close to $224 but over time its price moved up in an attempt to breach the $230 barrier. At press time, its trading at $233.\\nBitcoins price and on-chain indicators suggest that BTC investors are accumulating as much as possible, and historical data combined with low trading volumes point to a potentially significant price move coming in the near future.\\nThe number of\\nhourly new Bitcoin addresses being created\\nhas hit a two-year high of 22,390, above the previous peak of 22,387 seen in June 2019. The number of hourly active bitcoin addresses has also moved up to 60,379  the highest recorded in over a year. These figures suggest demand for BTC is growing, even if it isnt being reflected on the cryptocurrencys price.\\nBitcoins 30-day volatility index has, meanwhile, dropped to a 15-month low as according to available data its currently below 2%. The last time the index dropped below 2% it went all the way to 1.25% in March 2019. The drop preceded a bull run that saw the price of bitcoin move from $4,000 all the way to $13,000 by July 2019. By then, the index had moved to 6.94%.\\nIn November 2018, its worth noting, bitcoins 30-day volatility index dropped below 1.5%, preceding a price drop from over $6,000 to a $3,200 low in December 2018.\\nWhile the data points to a potential big move in the future and ongoing accumulation, a\\nfiling\\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) has raised $190 million for a bitcoin fund called the NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund.\\nThe fund has 24 unnamed investors and was originally registered with the SEC in 2018. The NYDIG has in March closed a $140 million fund the Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund, although it isnt clear whether the new fund is a rebrand, or if NYDIG is now one of the largest institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space in the United States, with $330 million invested in bitcoin across both funds.\\nResearch conducted by the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also found 1.9 million residents currently own cryptocurrencies, while 2.6 million are estimated to have bought crypto at some point. Out of the countrys general adult population, estimated to be of 50 million people, 3.86% own cryptoassets.\\nTo the FCA there was a statistically significant increase in cryptocurrency holders throughout the UK, as the percentage of people who at some point owned cryptoassets is now at 5.35%, up from 3% in 2019. Most, the\\nreport\\nsaid, seem to understand the risks associated with the lack of protections, the high volatility of the product and have some understanding of the underlying technology.\\nThose who do not understand cryptoassets could run into trouble, as research crypto cryptocurrency startup ZenGo recently unveiled a vulnerability affecting major cryptocurrency wallets that left them vulnerable to double-spend attacks.\\nThe attacks would leverage\\nbitcoins Replace-by-Fee\\nfeature, which lets a user send a bitcoin transaction with a low fee, and send the same bitcoin in another transaction with a higher fee. This cancels the original transactions, replacing it with the one with the higher fee. The vulnerability was found in wallets that accepted the unconfirmed transactions too quickly, as it left users vulnerable to attackers where the funds would be moved somewhere else before they received them.\\nCrypto-powered Social Media Platform Voice Launches\\nThe cryptocurrency-powered social media platform\\nVoice\\nhas opened its doors to the public. Anyone can now request access to the platform, which is essentially a decentralized version of Medium or Facebook. Until August 15, requesting access will still be required.\\nHowever, it is now already possible to see posts on the EOSIO-powered social media platform. Users are rewarded with Voice tokens for posting quality content, incentivizing good contributions. The company behind Voice, Block.one, ran a year-long ICO in which it raised $4 billion to launch EOSIO, the technology that powers the EOS blockchain.\\nAccording to a\\nreport, EOS is one of the top three decentralized application blockchains in the world, behind TRON and Ethereum. Ethereum, the report shows, was behind 85% of the $12 billion moved across decentralized applications in the second quarter of this year.\\nShare:', 'snippet': 'This week the price of <b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC) started trading around $9,150 and quickly moved up to $9,250.

As young adults working in the financial industry, we were told to stop dreaming and to just execute.\\nBut how can you innovate if you are not allowed to think outside the box?\\nAfter a decade of learning how to master Liars poker and dance with the Black swan, we decided to join forces to break with the traditional financial industry to create a new meritocratic ecosystem. An ambitious idea but one that we, and others, felt was long overdue.\\nThere was an old saying when America sneezes the world markets catches a cold. Well, today the statement is true for China. Environmental challenges and the global nature of pandemics and crises have underlined one thing very clearly: there is only 1 planet earth and we must fight inequalities and empower all her inhabitants to survive and thrive.\\nWhen the federal reserves or the ECB bail the markets and inflates the national currency, people should understand that if you do not invest in the financial markets you actually lose money. More importantly in most countries in the world investing is reserved for the elite: a whopping 1.7 Billion or more than 6O% of world citizens are unbanked or underbanked.\\nOur mission at SwissBorg is to offer Swiss wealth management to everyone by making it fair, fun and community-centric.\\nToo often, we believe that education equals books to read, we are the advocates of learning by doing. That is why we developed a Community app, a Bitcoin price prediction game with over 130,000 players forecasting on a daily basis. The app provides analytical tools, educational articles and Bitcoin price analysis to help the players with their predictions. Without risking any of their own money our community is learning the right habits while getting a chance to earn. Gamification is one of the best ways to drive interest and our data after 1 year of competition shows that our players forecasts have become more accurate over time.\\nThis past spring we launched our show-case product, our Wealth app which is now available in more than 100 countries, 17 fiats currencies and 7 digital assets. With its sophisticated financial engine, MPC cryptography, and identity verification, the app gives the user the freedom and security to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets easily and safely at best price execution.\\nFairness is important to us and we take our promise of transparency seriously. We communicate, regularly, openly and honestly with our community. We hold dear our commitment to referendums because we believe it is essential to our mission that our networks governance is maintained by collective wisdom.\\nWhile working in Hedge funds, we were taught to invest in graphs and statistics. Today more than ever, every investor should understand that you should not buy for profits alone. When you invest in stocks and cryptos you should do so because you want to buy and use a product or support the company to develop new features. And more importantly, you should invest for a personal purpose, something that you truly value. Making a 120% return investment on weapons may not be as satisfying as an 80% return on green energy.\\nWhy do we believe in decentralisation? Born on the Ethereum blockchain, with contributors spread around the globe, decentralization is in our DNA. SwissBorg is composed of individuals from more than 23 different countries, our team is shaped by many different cultural backgrounds. We pride ourselves for our commitment to gender equality and sexual orientation inclusivity. We listen to our community and collaborate as a family. Embracing differences makes us a better network. We want to look and act like the future that we are hoping to build.\\nAfter successfully raising over $52M with our ICO in 2018 from 23,000+ contributors hailing from 149 countries, launching the SwissBorg Token. Our CHSB is a multi-utility token that is the key to our ecosystem, allowing the holder such benefits as 0 % trading fees on our wealth app and voting rights in our referendum. Our goal is that all value creation made in our ecosystem be transmitted to our token.\\nLast but not least, what drives us?\\nA beautiful cocktail of: we dream big + we love our community! We take our mission of helping build a new world of finance that is fair and accessible, seriously. We work hard to build a better future for our tribe and reward our contributors fairly because SwissBorg has always been about: us!\\nFor more information please check out our\\nCyrus Fazel, your proud Founder, here to serve you.\\nShare:', 'snippet': '... developed a Community app, a <b>Bitcoin</b> price prediction game with over ... analytical tools, educational articles and <b>Bitcoin</b> price analysis to help the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2020-06-30T08:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image0-3.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.cityam.com/future-of-finance-community-centric-wealth-management-for-all/'}}, {'id': '5617549865245313757', 'title': '42-coin (42) Achieves Market Capitalization of $1.09 Million', 'url': 'https://www.wkrb13.com/2020/06/29/42-coin-42-achieves-market-capitalization-of-1-09-million.html', 'description': '42-coin (CURRENCY:42) traded up 3.1% against the US dollar during the 1-day period ending at 0:00 AM Eastern on June 28th.

To all our card customers: your fiat funds are safe and guaranteed by Crypto.com in case any of the services provided by Wirecard are disrupted, you will receive a fast 100% credit back to your crypto wallet. It is not clear at this stage which of the subsidiaries are going to be affected and if any of the services will be interrupted at all.

The Luxembourg-based fintech, that is currently setting up a subsidiary in Monaco, and its range of blockchain-based solutions, will allow the Principality to apply control and compliance to the Ethereum blockchain.

It was therefore surprising and puzzling to see, as reported by Bloomberg, that Brazils Central Bank has put a stop on it for evaluation and said the suspension will let it evaluate any possible risk to the countrys system of payments and to determine whether the payments system meets the necessary rules. Starting the service without the regulators green light could generate irreparable damage to the system, especially what concerns competition, efficiency and data privacy, the banks said, adding that Mastercard and Visa could face fines if they dont comply.\\nCrypto AM Community and COVID-19\\nIn this special extended version it has been amazing for me to find out more from the Crypto AM community about their efforts:-\\nBLOK Bioscience\\nAs I mentioned in my introduction the Crypto AM Community have been playing their part and you might have read the Crypto AM article The Building Blocks of Recoverywith Areiel Wolanow CTO of BLOK Biosciencediscussing their My Immunity Passport project that is due to go live in Brazil.

It goes to show that this peace of mind can be available to people quickly and I urge our own government to get behind companies like BLOK Bioscience!\\nWorld Mobile Chain & Virustatic Shield\\nMicky Watkins, CEO of World Mobile Chain, quarantined with his young family near Barcelona was determined to help in any way he could. He has been working closely with Virustatic Limited who produce the Virustatic Shield, a fabric snood-like face covering which features a protective protein called Viruferrin that has been developed and tested by experts for more than a decade. Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars. Recently it has been found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory tests conducted by independent scientists from VisMederi at the University of Siena. It creates a protective shield over human cells in the respiratory tract preventing the virus entering. In hosts that are already infected, it will stop the virus from multiplying.

After the deposit is processed, one can navigate to Mintrs LP rewards tab and stake the tokens in the Curvepool sBTC section.\\nHowever, one must be aware of high transaction fees.

In early 2009, the Bitcoin network launched with a headline in the genesis block: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. The motivations of the project were clear. With the frailty of our financial systems exposed, the quest to create an alternative, voluntary, transparent currency and peer-to-peer payment network began.\\nThis had been a long-pursued dream among crypto-anarchists and cypherpunks. Previous attempts like DigiCash and E-Gold suffered from a critical flaw. As these systems required a central operator, they were not resilient. By targeting this central point of failure, powerful adversaries like a government could shut them down. Satoshis critical breakthrough was the invention of Nakamoto consensus. In Nakamoto consensus each miner produces cryptographic hashes and only if the hash includes a certain amount of leading 0s, the networks nodes accept the corresponding block as valid. This process is also known as mining or Proof-of-Work (PoW).\\nParticipating in the PoW process is as simple as downloading software, syncing the blockchain, and using the machines computational power to look for hashes. The chance of producing a block depends on the rate at which one can produce these hashes. Since that is primarily a function of the computational power of the machine and energy deployed in the process, mining is a capital intensive, competitive game in which parties aim to reach the lowest cost through economies of scale. The advantage of mining is that as long as a majority of the hashing power is controlled by honest miners, the network can be trusted. If an attacker wanted to disrupt the network, they would need to invest a tremendous amount of resources to gain control of a majority of the hashing power. This condition ensures the security of the network. PoW powers the most popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite this track record, there are significant downsides to PoW. These limitations have driven work on alternative Sybil resistance mechanisms for many years, most notably Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\\nPoS is becoming the prevalent way of securing decentralised networks. PoS has many advantages over the battle-tested PoW, including faster block times and finality, lower operational costs, higher throughput, and a lower ecological impact. PoS is an umbrella term for Sybil resistance mechanisms that use native cryptoassets as collateral to determine participation in the consensus process of a blockchain network. The term collateral stems from the medieval Latin collateralis, from col- together with and lateralis (from latus, later)  side, indicating that collateral is something that is pledged in addition to the main obligation of a contract. In the context of PoS, the main obligation is for participating nodes to faithfully follow the protocols rules, which is ensured by putting up native cryptocurrency tokens as a security deposit  the collateral.\\nNodes associated with private keys that run the protocols software are called validators. Validators order and verify transactions, communicate with each other, and update their ledger to stay in sync with other participants in the network. As described above, validators in PoS networks are backed by collateral in the form of cryptocurrency tokens (stake). Token holders that stake (stakers) contribute to the network security by selecting trustworthy validators and increasing the cost of a potential attack. They receive tokens as compensation for this in proportion to their stake backing (staking rewards). The size of these rewards is also impacted by further factors such as network issuance rates, transaction fees spent within the network, staking participation rates, and validator-specific factors including uptime and commission rates.\\nThe market capitalisation of live PoS networks is already exceeding ten billion dollars. All PoS protocols require collateral to be placed in escrow controlled by the network in order to register validators in the consensus process. In most protocols the staked collateral can be seized should the associated validator provably deviate from the protocols rules (slashing). This mechanism is used to disincentivise attacks on the network, such as signing two different blocks of transactions at the same height (double-signing). Some protocols such as Avalanche and Ouroboros do not use slashing and instead rely solely on honesty assumptions.\\nEscrowing staked assets prevents them from being transferred or used in decentralised finance applications. In addition, a delay (unbonding period) is often enforced by protocols when one wants to stop participating to recover staked assets. Such restrictions impose economic costs on the holders of staked assets.\\nAs a consequence, solutions to circumvent the limitations on staked assets are being developed. Centralised exchanges can easily circumvent these limitations by pooling assets and allowing off-chain agreements to encumber them without relying on on-chain enforcement. A burgeoning field has arisen under the moniker of liquid staking, which is seeking to tokenize staked assets to remove restrictions on them and to increase possibilities of how they can be used. Liquid staking is rapidly developing since stakers are looking for ways to increase their capital efficiency.\\nWe are on the cusp of massive transition in how most blockchain networks are secured. While the best-known networks Bitcoin and Ethereum still run on PoW, with Tezos and Cosmos  two major PoS networks launched in 2018 and 2019. Now, countless others have launched or are coming to market in the next 18 months. Blockchains are still in the early phase of building out fundamental infrastructure and finding use cases capable of reaching mainstream adoption. But what has become clear is that staking will play a crucial role in securing most blockchain networks  and thus likely critical in providing the foundation for the financial system of the future. But the design space around PoS is vast and, so far, little systematic analysis around the best economic designs has been done. There has not been enough consideration about the long-term impact of restrictions commonly imposed on staking assets. In particular, the inability to use staked assets collateral in other applications and the often lengthy unbonding periods have serious economic costs.\\nThe most existential risk for PoS networks is exchange staking. Partly driven by their ability to circumvent on-chain restrictions and partially by the simpler user experience and brand, exchanges have rapidly gained market share and accumulated staking assets on their platforms. The negative repercussions are large if this continues. They range from defunding community validators to decreasing network resilience to potential corruption o', 'snippet': 'CityAM - Satoshi Nakamotos <b>Bitcoin</b> whitepaper emerged from the global financial crisis of 2008.

More specifically, should bitcoin surpass its prior high and close a full-bodied candle above $10,700, this would be an indication that buying pressure is outweighing sell-side action.\\nShould bitcoin fail to rally past this level, the outlook still isnt grim, but simply extends the time-line for new all-time-highs with a deeper correction period. As such, these next few days will provide a somewhat crucial indication as to what could be expected and when.\\nFigure 1\\nFrom a technical perspective, bitcoin is trading within a bullish ascending triangle formation (discounting the 2\\nnd\\nJune Coinbase pump and dump price-action).\\nHoming in on Junes price action, its clear that this month has been characterised by a series of consolidation moves through and through. In fact, bitcoin has printed consecutive lower highs and lower lows on the daily time-frame, indicating a build-up before a possible attempt to continue the trend, or for a trend reversal to ensue.\\nAs per previous mailouts the levels to keep an eye on are $8,600, $9,300 and $10,000, respectively. Should bitcoin fall below $8,600, which coincides with the 200- daily exponential moving average (EMA), then a deeper correction towards the $7,500 breakout area can be expected.\\nFigure 2\\nOn the flipside, now that bitcoin has successfully bounced from the 50-daily EMA, a retest of $9,800 to $10,000 is in the cards. Ultimately though, bulls will have to push through the local high of $10,500 in order to convincingly declare a trend continuation. A daily close above this level will open the door to $11,000 and beyond.\\nTaking a look at price-action during this entire structure, its also evident that $9,300 has acted as a clear pivot point, flipping into support and resistance depending on trends on lower time frames. The Volume profile at this level is also relatively high, indicating high trading activity when price meets this level.\\nShifting to our technical indicators, the Money Flow Index (MFI)  which is effectively a volume-weighted RSI  has flashed two consecutive buy-signals on the daily time-frame. Notably, this indicator is at odds with the Relative Strength Index, which has now flipped marginally bullish, but could still be considered in neutral territory at the time of writing. Often enough, these indicators can compliment each other when seen in confluence.\\nBitcoin fundamentals have never been stronger\\nMeanwhile, recent data from Glassnode media  arguably the industry gold standard for on-chain crypto data  shows that bitcoiners have become highly unwilling to part with their bitcoin. Indeed, bitcoin balances on exchanges is now as low as it was since May 2019 during the mini-bull run.\\nAs it happens, people are just about to begin realising that their fiat money has far less purchasing power than it did just a few months ago, as the trillions of freshly printed dollars begin to weigh in on the wider economy  likely adding to a net inflationary effect.\\nJust this week, a CNBC reportshowed that bank deposits had increased by $2 trillion since January after record amounts of stimulus were injected into US bank accounts in an effort to ease lockdown measures. As of June, US commercial bank deposits surpassed $15.4 trillion. Typically, deflation precedes inflation  which seems to be happening as we speak.\\nAny way you look at it, this growth has been absolutely extraordinary, said Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research. Banks are flooded with cash, theyre like Scrooge McDuck swimming in money.\\nAll in all, it appears that the barrage of efforts from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, have overshot their targets in spectacular fashion. Coupled with bitcoins fundamentally strong narrative, improving network fundamentals, increasing demand and decreased supply (post-halving), its not hyperbolic to say that there has never been a stronger case for bitcoin.\\nAs I write this, it appears that PayPal will now offer Bitcoin purchases to its 300 million users.\\nChristopher Attard writes a semi-weekly newsletter covering bitcoin, crypto and relevant events in the industry.', 'snippet': 'CityAM - <b>Bitcoin</b> is fast approaching a crescendo moment that might set the tone for the coming weeks against a backdrop that.

BGL uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. BGL Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.\\nAchievements Unlocked\\nIts primary incentives revolve around a transactional coin burning mechanism with a burn rate of 90% of tx fees to create a digital scarcity of the asset, a block weight of less than 400,000 which is 10 times smaller than Bitcoin, and it is 100% Segwit, which eliminates the problems associated with legacy types of transactions. BitGesells BGL currency should definitely appeal to blockchains value chain  miners, investors, and network participants.\\nIt appears that the BitGesell project aims to contend with BTC as the true attribute for digital gold a concept which resonates deep within the cryptocurrency industry, often depicted by Bitcoins limited supply and its economic model of halving miners reward every four years. However, halving on BitGesell occurs every year, scaling its economic design 4 times that of Bitcoin, leading to the faster unveiling of the future of Bitcoin.\\nEven though its still early days for the BitGesell project, its achievement so far can be considered monumental to its scale. These achievements include a small GPU miner provided by its rapidly growing community, alongside an\\n, and a community wallet which has been specified in the very first BitGesell block mined, that will receive funds to be distributed for further project growth. Further, mining software cutting across major operating systems to include: Mac, Linux, and Windows.\\nActive mining pools currently supporting the chain include', 'snippet': 'When <b>Bitcoin</b> emerged in 2009, the original vision was ... simple as the concept sounds, the original <b>Bitcoin</b> code may not have accounted for certain ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-06-16T06:44:31', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bitgesell.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/purposed-digital-gold-bitgesell-unlocks-another-achievement-with-hotbit-exchange-listing/'}}, {'id': '941457694113913051', 'title': 'Nearly 3 Million Bitcoin Addresses Hold at Least 0.1 BTC  The Merkle News', 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/nearly-3-million-bitcoin-addresses-hold-at-least-0-1-btc/', 'description': 'According to Glassnode, there are now nearly 3 million Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC.This is a very sharp increase compared to early 2020.', 'body': \"Statistics play a crucial role in any industry, and cryptocurrencies are no exception.

The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\\nBitcoin can be traded on the following cryptocurrency exchanges:  Coincheck,  Cryptopia,  Instant Bitex,  EXX,  Gemini,  YoBit,  Kucoin,  Kraken,  DragonEX,  CoinBene,  Bit-Z,  B2BX,  Korbit,  Gate.io,  CoinsBank,  DOBI trade,  Bitinka,  Coinbase Pro,  IDAX,  Coinroom,  Cobinhood,  GOPAX,  Binance,  UEX,  Bitlish,  BTC-Alpha,  LATOKEN,  RightBTC,  BitMEX,  Livecoin,  Fatbtc,  BiteBTC,  Exmo,  FCoin,  Coinsuper,  ABCC,  Huobi,  Exrates,  Bibox,  CoinTiger,  OOOBTC,  LakeBTC,  Tidex,  IDCM,  InfinityCoin Exchange,  ChaoEX,  OKEx,  BtcTrade.im,  Zaif,  Cryptonex,  Bittrex,  BTCBOX,  Paribu,  BitMart,  Bithumb,  TOPBTC,  Hotbit,  Mercatox,  CPDAX,  Allcoin,  Coinsquare,  Poloniex,  Iquant,  Bitbank,  Covesting,  HitBTC,  Coindeal,  BigONE,  CoinEx,  BitBay,  LocalTrade,  QuadrigaCX,  Coinbe,  HADAX,  CEX.IO,  Simex,  Kryptono,  Trade By Trade,  ZB.COM,  LBank,  Sistemkoin,  Negocie Coins,  Liquid,  OEX,  bitFlyer,  Ovis,  DigiFinex,  BCEX,  xBTCe, BitForex,  Vebitcoin,  Bitstamp,  Upbit,  Bitfinex,  Coinhub,  C2CX,  CoinEgg,  itBit,  Coinone,  Bitsane and  MBAex.

Bitcoin has a programmatically fixed supply, it exists outside of any central entitys control and can be considered truly borderless.\\nBut the how of bitcoin investment can be a little more daunting. How to take part in the bitcoin ecosystem, how to best invest your dollars into BTC, how to construct this investment so that it is most beneficial and tax advantaged in the long term  in short, how to get started is often the hardest part.\\nThe good news is that there is an easy way to direct traditional investment toward bitcoin that many dont know about. You can join the bitcoin revolution through a very familiar investment vehicle: your IRA.\\nA Traditional Investment Vehicle, Made Revolutionary\\nHeres how the typical process goes with IRAs: either you or your financial advisor creates an IRA in your name, and then uses it to invest in traditional investments  such as bonds or stocks. And theres almost no chance that those IRA dollars would ever touch cryptocurrency, meaning that BTC and other alternative assets could never benefit from the tax advantages of an IRA.\\nAlternative IRA custodians grant you full control to invest in alternative investments beyond the traditional stock market  you make your own decision about where and how to invest your IRA dollars.\\nA few years ago, the IRS classified bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as property, allowing it to be included in IRAs, along with other investments (called alternative investments) like real estate, venture capital, private equity and shares of art.\\nThese alternative IRA accounts, often referred to as self-directed IRAs\\n, can be structured in the forms that many investors are used to, most commonly: traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAs. Each type of IRA offers unique advantages, and determining which one is right for you will depend on your age, income, investor profile and overall goals.\\nAlternative IRA accounts have the same contribution limits as the other IRAs. The contribution limit through 2020 is $6,000 for those under 50 years old, or $7,000 for those 50 years old and older.\\nWhy You Should Invest in Bitcoin With an Alto CryptoIRA\\nBecause of regulatory changes and advances in technology, alternative IRAs are now more powerful than ever  allowing everyday investors to place funds in alternative investments and enjoy the tax-friendly advantages of an IRA.\\nTo simplify investing in bitcoin with your IRA, Alto has created a special IRA just for crypto enthusiasts called, fittingly enough, the Alto CryptoIRA Here are the benefits to opening an Alto CryptoIRA:\\nFreedom to choose with your retirement money. Most brokerages and custodians dont allow investments in alternative assets with IRAs, because these assets are typically illiquid. Thats not the case with Alto. You can use IRA dollars to buy bitcoin with a CryptoIRA from Alto.\\nMake tax-free bitcoin trades. Active traders, pay attention: This is a huge plus to anyone who is watching the bitcoin market closely (and who isnt?). An Alto CryptoIRA also gives you the ability to make tax-free trades. For example, you can sell bitcoin at $10,000 without having to worry about capital gains, and then buy again when bitcoin is at $8,000.\\nGains grow tax deferred. With an Alto CryptoIRA, BTC gains come to you tax free. You wont have to pay tax if the value of BTC increases over time. If you got in years ago when the price was $1,000 and then sold when it was $10,000, you would not have to pay taxes on the gains. In fact, youll never pay taxes on any of those gains or whatever you invest them in next until you start to take taxable distributions later in life.\\nEase and cost. Though it hasnt always been this way Alto has built a unique and easy platform to simplify investing into alternatives. They have even created a dedicated IRA just for cryptocurrency investing, no LLC required, called the Alto CryptoIRA. In addition to investing in bitcoin with an IRA, you can create additional IRAs for investing in other opportunities, including those offered by their many partners\\nOne thing to keep in mind: Your total IRA contribution amount spans across all of your IRA accounts. You can have multiple IRAs, but all of your contributions can only equal $6,000 for the year. You are also limited from contributing to a Roth IRA, depending on your annual income. That said, you can rollover any amount of cash from an existing IRA to Alto without being capped and without penalty.\\nConclusion: The Growth of SDIRAs and Alternative Investments\\nInvesting in alternative assets with self-directed IRAs is only gaining in popularity with leading investors. Research made exclusive to AltoIRA showed that 27 percent of those with a household income of $1 million or more are interested in alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Other industry analysts expect the market for alternative investments to hit $14 trillionby 2023.\\nAnd its simple to join this growing trend at an opportune time, and begin investing in this market with an Alto CryptoIRA\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\nTrending Topics', 'snippet': 'For many, the value proposition of <b>Bitcoin</b> is easy to understand, especially in relation to more traditional investments. <b>Bitcoin</b> has a ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-06-08T00:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1529102296', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/yes-you-can-use-an-ira-for-bitcoin-investing-2020-06-08'}}, {'id': '4471924003941844625', 'title': 'BitBuddy launches Bitcoin explorer- a web tool to access all Bitcoin statistics', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/bitbuddy-launches-bitcoin-explorer-a-web-tool-to-access-all-bitcoin-statistics/amp-11591289344716.html', 'description': 'Bitcoin is a public blockchain, and records are saved on various computer systems across the globe.BitBuddy allows sellers and buyers to sell and buy directly on its platform', 'body': 'BitBuddy, a Bitcoin marketplace has announced the launch of Bitcoin Explorer -- an open-source web tool that allows users to gather information about blocks, addresses, and transactions on Bitcoin blockchain.', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b> is a public blockchain, and records are saved on various computer systems across the globe.BitBuddy allows sellers and buyers to sell and buy ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-06-04T16:54:49', 'provider': {'name': 'livemint', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/06/04/600x338/Bitbuddy_image_1591289435075_1591289458688.png', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'livemint', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/bitbuddy-launches-bitcoin-explorer-a-web-tool-to-access-all-bitcoin-statistics/amp-11591289344716.html'}}, {'id': '1699228948646153187', 'title': 'Bundle Africa on the AppStore', 'url': 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bundle-africa/id1506502199', 'description': 'Read reviews, compare customer ratings, see screenshots, and learn more about Bundle Africa.

New coins are being made due to the work of millions of computers all around the world with usage of the program for computation of mathematical algorithms. Thats what Bitcoin is about. Its developers pseudonym is Satoshi Nakamoto  he (or she or they) has come forward with an electronic payment system based on mathematical computations. The idea was to create the way to exchange coins in electronic form without centralised control and more or less instantly.\\nIt has been 11 years since Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper and crypto market has since grown enormously.

The', 'body': 'Tuesday 26 May 2020 9:39 am\\nBrave beginnings\\nCrypto AM: Founders Series\\nGeorge McDonaugh and Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1 plc\\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2016, Bitcoin was trading at $412.07 and Ethereum was hot on its heels at $10.86. The KR1 team had just inked a deal to take a dormant publicly listed former Romanian property investment company and turn it into a publicly listed crypto fund. Every single person involved in the process, whether legal, administration or fundraising (except for the KR1 founding team obviously) had never even heard the word cryptocurrency or Ethereum before in their lives and loosely associated Bitcoin with some shady things on the dark web.\\nInvestors look for trends in the market to build up a picture of what may come down the line. Bull markets, short squeezes, FUD, accumulation, precipitous sell offs, and lost wallets are all part of the crypto market curriculum, but to get a strong sense of the macro trend, its useful to understand how far the digital asset space has come.\\nKR1 is uniquely placed to provide a window into cryptos early days because when we inked the incorporation documents for the company, much of the great rise of crypto to global attention was yet to get underway. Our aim in starting the company back in 2016 was to allow investors exposure to the crypto economy via a publicly listed share. In essence, to create a basket of early-stage digital assets, oftentimes via opportunities unavailable for most people, that would track the movements of the emerging innovating crypto ecosystem. We didnt at the time fully realise wed just hitched our wagon to the most insane roller coaster ride ever devised.\\nThere had been just two Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) when we started to build our digital asset portfolio and we were busy setting up banking, internal storage processes and other such things a crypto fund needed.\\nThe infrastructure was being built around us and with us. We were an emerging investment company in an emerging space, relying on the experience the team had gained having lived through the early era of Bitcoin and trading many of its clones like Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.\\nOur first investment into an ICO could best be described as tentatively dipping a toe for we went big and put in the princely sum of 5,000 into the SingularityDTV token sale smart contract. Bearing in mind KR1 got started with only around 200,000 of funds raised in the early days, investing this felt like a fairly good sum to start with. Shortly after, the Golem ICO came along and we went a little bigger to acquire Golem tokens at one cent via the smart contract and then bought another chunk at the same price a few weeks later when the Golem tokens started trading on a then-new Chinese exchange Yunbi (which by now have already shut their doors again due to government regulations in China).\\nGolems token price began to rise and KR1 loosened up and started looking to place a bigger investment, already bolstered by how the rest of the portfolio (Ethereum, Augur and SingularDTV) was performing. We skipped a few projects coming to market (back then it was only a few a month) and finally settled on the Melon Protocol, spearheaded by Melonport, to really start investing in size. The founder Mona El Isa painted a compelling vision of a trust-less one-click hedge fund on the blockchain, which perfectly utilizes the innovation behind Ethereum and Bitcoins breakthroughs, and we wrote our first six-digit cheque. After anxiously awaiting the Melon Protocol public sale for three weeks, the Melon token listed on exchanges at a high double digit multiple of the price we negotiated and we were well and truly beginning to fly.\\nThere were so many highlights from 2017: A bleary-eyed 4.00am Cosmos ICO session placing a six-digit cheque into it that later returned millions and validated the companys strategy for some time to come; a fairly nail biting last second entry into the Qtum ICO to the tune of some Bitcoins, which later returned KR1 many multiples, and seed funding FunFair over a Thai lunch, after weeks of digging into their break-through tech in the Ethereum space, writing one of our biggest cheques at that time.\\nA testament to our due diligence and investment processes are not just the past investment successes but also many of the bullets we dodged on the way. These include never having lost any funds in any of the multiple crypto exchange hacks or wallets and also not participating in ICOs like the Telegram token sale, the EOS sale or projects that struggled massively with regulatory concerns like Kik.\\nOver the years, KR1 has funded a hugely influential number of projects and become one of the most active investors in Decentralised Finance (DeFi) in terms of projects we have supported including Argent, Connext, Nexus Mutual, the Melon Protocol, Acala or Union to name a few.\\nA big strategic decision that informed KR1s early investments in Cosmos, Polkadot and eventually Dfinity was the notion of Proof-of-Stake networks and the associated staking activities. Proof-of-Stake networks replace the enormous electrical energy and computer hardware required in Proof-of-Work networks, such as Bitcoin, with a more sophisticated digital algorithm that instead of wasting energy only requires a value-bearing deposit to use as collateral to ensure network participants behave truthfully. Participants putting up this deposit are being rewarded for validating the network and earn an income on the collateral they provide.\\nKR1s portfolio composition today and largest investments made thus far represent exactly that reasoning, with Cosmos being KR1s largest holding and placing $1,000,000 in Polkadots earliest funding round, our largest investment to date. Branching out from being a highly successful early stage investment company into additionally becoming a revenue-generating company is the path were on as of right now. By generating yields from our portfolio assets, KR1 could potentially offset some company costs or add to our available pool of investment capital to support more and more promising projects.\\nToday the crypto landscape has changed immeasurably from when we started and we keep pushing the boundaries of this technology as well. Some of the largest traditional finance macro traders and family offices have woken up to allow their portfolios to hold Bitcoin in a digital gold narrative, though they are still completely missing the big picture of the innovation being built out in real time in the crypto space. The crypto market has bounced back strongly from the global liquidity sell-off caused by Covid-19, benefiting heavily from the brrrrr free fiat money printing headlines all over the globe. Ethereum has found a strong product market fit with the explosion of DeFi related products and is fast becoming an entirely new financial ecosystem.

Why?\\nby\\n\\nMay 23, 2020\\nTether, the worlds most popular stablecoin, has been pumping up the volume. Since January, $4.7 billion Tethers have been ushered into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Now, there are nearly $9 billion Tethers in circulation.\\nNearly half of all Tether issued since October 6, 2014, when the dollar token first came into existence, were created in the last five months. (If you look at a line graph of Tether issuance, starting at the beginning of this year, it starts to look like a jagged staircase, marked by small plateaus and vertical lines that lurch straight upwards.)\\nSo whats going on? Why do we need all of these Tethers, and why such apparent urgency?\\nThe blue line shows Tether issuance from October 2014 to now. (Image: CoinMarketCap)\\nThe Bitcoin skeptic\\nOne Bitcoin skeptic sees it as an ominous sign that real dollars in the crypto ecosystemthe network of exchanges, over-the-counter trading desks, and other ways people trade cryptoare starting to disappear, steadily sucked out by Bitcoin miners who need them to pay their monstrous electricity bills.\\nMiners have to sell BTC for real money, Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told\\nDecrypt\\n. Tether is a fine substitute for real money for those playing at the rigged stock market simulation, but it cant substitute for paying power bills.\\nWeaver, who views Bitcoin mainly as a tool for criminal elements, has been looking into the popular cryptocurrency since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. Last year, he railed against crypto in a talk called Burn it with fire, at the Enigma security conference in California.\\nHe also frequently tweets his critiques of BTC. The problem is miners need $ not Tether to pay power bills, so over the past few months there has been a great sucking as Tether has replaced $, he tweeted recently. When $ goes to 0, the system collapses.\\nBy collapse, he means that the price of BTC could drop to the point that 51% attacks become so cheap that Bitcoin ceases to be usable.\\n\\nWildcat banking?\\nTether, for the uninitiated, is a virtual token pegged to the US dollar. Exchanges, typically those that lack links to traditional banking, use it in lieu of real dollars as a way to bring liquidity to the crypto markets and hedge against volatility.\\nA few thingswell, more than a fewmake Tether controversial. One is that it is controlled by Bitfinex, a popular cryptocurrency exchange that operates out of Asia.\\nBut the main sticking point is Tethers claim that Tethers (USDT) are backed 1:1 to the dollar. Nobody knows for sure whats behind Tethers. Nobody has ever come forward saying theyve been able to redeem Tethers, which were supposed to be an I.O.U. for real dollars. (That was the original deal, at least. Send them dollars and they would send you back Tethers; return the Tethers and youd get your dollars back.)\\nOver time, the rules of the game changed. In April 2019, Bitfinexs general counsel Stuart Hoegner admitted in court documentsthat Tether was only 74% backed by cash and cash equivalents, lending credence to the theorythat Tethers are increasingly being minted out of thin air. (Bitfinex is being investigatedby the office of the New York Attorney General.) He made that claim when there was only $2.8 billion worth of Tether in circulation.\\nNow, there are three times that amount.\\nNeither Stuart Hoegner, nor Tethers communications department, nor Bitfinex responded to requests for comment.\\nWhat we dont know\\nArguably, one of the most important numbers in crypto is how much actual-dollar cash is floating around in the system. That number is equally as important as the number of Tethers. Both provide liquidity, making it easy to buy and sell BTC. Both help to set the price of Bitcoin. But only actual dollars can pay the costs of running the network.\\nOf course, the number is almost impossible to ascertain. Crypto exchanges that have banking (either they are directly linked to banks or they use a shadow banking service, such as Crypto Capital Corp) are reluctant to share the information.\\nAnd over-the-counter trading desks, which trade crypto in large batches, often operate behind the scenes. And thats not even counting the close to 8,000 Bitcoin ATMson the planet, where individuals can purchase Bitcoin for cash, often anonymously, in places like cigar shops or convenience stores.\\nWhat we do know\\nWe can, however, get a sense of Bitcoins cash situation by considering\\nwhat we do know.\\nWe know how much new Bitcoin is entering the supply, based on the block reward. We know that the price of Bitcoin is determined by the total number of dollars in the system, which is a mix of both cash and Tethers.\\nAnd we know that Tether is issuing its virtual dollars\\nat a clip of $33 million per day over the last five months\\na strong indicator that the level of actual cash in the system is in a perilous decline, according to Weaver.\\nElectricity costs\\nJust how much cash is disappearing from the system in energy costs? According to an estimatepublished by researchers at the University of Cambridge, the Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than a small countrywhat Weaver calls obscene.\\nBased on 5 cents per kWh, the Bitcoin network needs to spend roughly $335,000 every hour, Alex de Vries, a blockchain specialist, at Big Four accounting firm PwC told\\nDecrypt\\n. That means someone has to be on hand to buy nearly $8 million worth of new Bitcoin a day for cashjust to secure the system.\\nThose costs are putting the squeeze on miners right now.\\nThey earn 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes in block rewards. At $9,000 per BTC, that equates to $340,000 an hour. At the moment, they have to sell every BTC they mine to pay electricity costs. (Previous to the halving event on May 12, it was 12.5 BTC, so they were earning more.) The average costs will drop to 2 to 3 cents per kWh between May and September, de Vrie said. Thats because over 50% of Bitcoin miningis centered in the Sichuan province of China, which benefits from lower costs of hydropower energy in the wet season.\\nElectricity isnt the only cost miners have to bear. They have to pay for their rigs, which can run up to $3,000 apiece and need to be replaced frequently as faster ASIC machines become available. They also have to pay rent, taxes, wages, and all the other costs of running a business. All of these things need to be paid in real dollars or yuan, not Tethers, resulting in a steady net drain of cash out of the ecosystem.\\nWeaver argues that even if the miners hold on to their new BTC, as opposed to selling them right away, that still draws cash out of the system. Because it lowers the supply of available BTC on the markets and raises the price of the BTC that they do sell.\\nSupply and demand must match to determine the price. If the supply is less, the price would go up, he said.\\nBut arent there enough whales (large holders of Bitcoin) in the syste', 'snippet': 'Since January, $4.7 billion Tethers have been ushered into the <b>Bitcoin</b> ecosystem.

The notion of quickly and seamlessly converting fiat into bitcoin in small, regular increments has lowered a perceived barrier that BTC investment requires large, single purchases and has encouraged Bitcoiners to build up their HODLings on a regular basis.\\nOf the handful of services that allow users to stack sats, FastBitcoinsmay be filling a unique niche. It offers in-person bitcoin buying in physical outlets, where users can directly convert their fiat cash into BTC. And, as of today, that service includes the ability to dollar-cost average their investments.\\nFrom today, registered FastBitcoins users can automatically buy bitcoins at a frequency of their choice, according to an announcement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The only thing they will need to do is ensure that their FastBitcoin account remains topped up with a sufficient cash balance. When a purchase is made, users receive an email from FastBitcoins confirming it and requesting a delivery address or Lightning invoice for their bitcoins to be delivered straight away.\\nDollar-cost averaging is a method of BTC investment that is growing in popularity alongside the stack sats movement. Rather than trying to time large BTC investments when its price is relatively high, the method allows investors to average their purchases and reduce the impact of volatility.\\nNew features such as automatic dollar-cost averaging gives users the ability to hold balances denominated in their local currencies and will ultimately allow them to have complete flexibility when purchasing bitcoins, said Danny Brewster, managing director of FastBitcoins, per the release. We also ensure users get delivery of their bitcoins straight away.\\nCritically, FastBitcoins will maintain its other advanced features as it integrates the new service and adapts to the European Unions Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) a set of rules that govern financial companies to ensure best practices for deterring money laundering, but pose unique challenges for private bitcoin investment and custody.\\nWe were able to incorporate these regulatory measures without compromising on user experience and our core principles, Brewster said. That means we remain a non-custodial exchange, and deliver bitcoins almost instantly to customers either on-chain or on the Lighting Network.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\nTrending Topics', 'snippet': 'So far, <b>Bitcoin</b> adoption in 2020 has been defined ... of quickly and seamlessly converting fiat into bitcoin in small, regular increments has lowered a ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-20T00:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1910600638', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastbitcoins-launches-dollar-cost-averaging-feature-2020-05-20'}}, {'id': '7767858121133787468', 'title': 'Bitcoin Is Leaving Banking Stocks in the Dust', 'url': 'https://www.geezwild.com/bitcoin-is-leaving-banking-stocks-in-the-dust/', 'description': 'Bitcoin (BTC) continues to outperform major U.S. banking stocks so far in 2020 despite seeing a massive sell-off in mid-March.

It's a sign the BTC network reached its imposed limits governing how well it can serve its community.\\nIf they head over to\\nBitcoin SV\\n, they will notice that their fees are less than a fraction of 1% of what users pay to send transactions on the BTC blockchain. BSV achieved this pricing model while also processing 2-3x higher in the volume of transactions. It is the only blockchain that massively scales and is the world's only true micropayments system.\\nBitcoin SV follows Satoshi's economic model that transaction fees will overtake the block subsidy reward as the primary source of revenue for companies supporting the infrastructure. Basic societal norms show that mainstream users will only adopt a fee structure that is stable and competitive with other existing mediums of exchange.\\nHow often would somebody frequent a grocery store chain where they charged variable fees that exceeds their bank's charges? Or where they allowed other shoppers to cut in front of them in the queue if they agreed to even higher fees.\\nSatoshi understood this point, which is why Bitcoin SV protocol developers kept with that vision. The BSV network now rivals credit card processor VISA in terms of transactions per second, opening up the blockchain network to a myriad of consumer services.\\nThey base their income forecast primarily on the market value of the BTC digital currency protocol's reward them for discovery a block. They will still gladly profit from any extra revenue opportunity presented to them as long as they do not have to take new actions.\\nBTC has proven to be an ineffective solution for a global\", 'snippet': \"<b>Bitcoin</b> SV follows Satoshi's economic model that transaction fees will overtake the block subsidy reward as the primary source of revenue for ...\", 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-13T14:30:00', 'provider': {'name': 'prnewswire', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': '/content/dam/prnewswire/common/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'prnewswire', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/soaring-btc-fees-are-hurting-the-community-bitcoin-sv-fees-are-less-than-a-fraction-of-1--876547863.html'}}, {'id': '3464854296865432475', 'title': \"There are Fewer BTC on the Lightning Network Compared to Ethereum's WBTC  The Merkle News\", 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/there-are-fewer-btc-on-the-lightning-network-compared-to-ethereums-wbtc/', 'description': 'Statistics seem to confirm that the Lightning Network isn\\'t captivating much of an audience.

It is not possible to predict exactly how a world of negative interest rates will develop. However, it is clear that the very foundations of the system of international finance are coming under increasing strain.\\nIn this context, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and the unique attributes they possess can no longer be ignored by international investors. It is time to readjust your investment portfolio to the new market paradigm.\\nInflation: An Illusion\\nIt may not be visible or obvious but as the money supply increases with quantitative easing (QE), the value of fiat currency depreciates. Although our purchasing power regarding primary consumer goods doesnt seem to have changed much over the last 10 years (as reflected in the CPI), there are other factors that will hit us very hard. Unions and workers still exist today but workers, even as an economic aggregate, are replaced either by outsourcing the production to countries with cheaper labor and poorer working conditions or by centralised automation. Therefore, in an extremely competitive and well organized international market, we face the illusion that prices will never go up and inflation is not significant. On top of this, malicious practices such as built-in obsolescence have become the norm and although this doesnt impact the facing price of consumer goods but, by shortening our life expectancy, creates indirect inflation. But none of these factors have been taken into account with the vanity metrics coming from the CPI. The exact same negative spirale has been going on for over a century,\\nQuantitative Easing, Buybacks & Fiat Debasement: A Reality\\nOn the contrary, assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate are constantly heading north. As the economy became more and more leveraged through endless buybacks indicating that inflation can be observed and its dangerous. Approximately $60 trillion of US dollar denominated debt (demand) is held globally relative to a monetary base (supply) of around $4.5 trillion.\\nThis is only the beginning of aggressive central bank intervention. With global debt at $255 trillion or 322% of global GDP, its unlikely that these accommodative policies will ever be reversed. During the great financial crisis and over the course of 1.5 years, the Fed added $1.5 trillion to its balance sheet. In 2020, the Fed has printed over $2 trillion in less than 60 days!\\nWhen a massive amount of money like this is injected into the system, investors are looking to hedge themselves against the risk of monetary debasement and start to buy assets in limited supply: real estates, stocks, precious metals and more recently Bitcoin as a non-correlated asymmetric return asset.\\nBitcoin is controlled by no government or central entity and its quantitative tightening monetary policy is enforced by an algorithm that cant be reversed. It is an asset of unique characteristics in the current environment. To this point, and often misunderstood by traditional investors, Bitcoin is gaining in popularity among long term investors:\\nAsymmetric Distribution of Returns: Sustainability\\nThe essence of investment management, said by the legendary investor Benjamin Graham, is the management of risks, not the management of returns.\\nMarket Crashes of the past twenty years have led many investors to reexamine some of the key assumptions that lie at the heart of modern portfolio theory. The favorite topic of investment gurus Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Ray Dalio among others is portfolio management focusing on asymmetric returns (i.e investment strategies that maximize upside potential while capping downside risks) This has become the recipe for sustainable investment strategies.\\nWhen comparing the distribution of daily returns between Bitcoin and S&P 500, it is clear that the digital currency outclasses the performance of the 500 largest US companies by a far stretch. The recent market deep episode is a good illustration of that difference, as noticed by Bloomberg senior analyst Mike McGlone: Bitcoin is showing divergent strength versus the wobbly stock market, noting the cryptocurrencys rapid decline on March 12, when it plunged 27%. As for the record, BTC rose past $10,000 in early May, largely spurred by the impending halving.\\nAs shown in SwissBorg research or Binance research, over the course of the last 7 years, a portfolio composed of 50% of MSCI WORLD Index & 50% Core Total USD Bond Market can greatly improve its risk/return ratio by incorporating as little as 2% of Bitcoin in its allocation.\\nAnother interesting fact is that the correlation between Bitcoin and gold is now at a historical high, signaling that Bitcoin is now considered by international investors as a safe haven.\\nWith Bitcoin now up more than 100% off of its March 12th lows and a lagging recovery in the stock market, it is more than likely that Bitcoin follows the path of gold a few decades ago in becoming part of the international investors asset universe.\\nA final note  While Bitcoin halving events are important, it is still limited to a single and limited factor mainly impacting miners in the short-run. If we really want to understand bitcoins potential as money 2.0, it is important to understand the future devaluation and debasement of the major fiat currencies while taking into consideration all 5 of the players directly impacting the BTCs price action.\\nIf you believe in Bitcoins properties and potential, you can now buy BTC with', 'snippet': 'CityAM - <b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC) has been labeled as an uncorrelated asset since BTC is not directly connected to global GDP, company, revenues,.  also peaked ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-12T08:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8fb1fed8-dd83-4718-aee2-4f88a43161f3.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.cityam.com/bitcoin-five-factors-one-conclusion-three-parts/'}}, {'id': '260303729041451090', 'title': 'Chinese Telecom Giant to Integrate Blockchain Technology Into 5G Systems', 'url': 'https://btcmanager.com/chinese-telecom-blockchain-technology-5g-systems/', 'description': 'China Telecom, a leading Chinese telecommunications company, has revealed that blockchain technology will be massively integrated into its 5G systems as the revolutionary tech behind bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins.

This will have the following implications: Miners will now receive only 50% of the Bitcoins as a block reward, earning 6.25 BTC after the halving instead of 12.5 BTC. Since the block reward will be halved, the number of Bitcoins entering circulation will be halved too. So now 6.25 Bitcoins will be created every 10 minutes for the next 4 years before being halved again. This means over the next 4 years, 1,312,500 Bitcoins will be produced and after the next halving (2024) only 656,250 Bitcoins will be generated until the 5th Bitcoin Halving in 2028. With the number of Bitcoins being generated every 10 minutes being cut in half, this will bring increased scarcity to the popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin  is already scarce due to its limited supply and the fact that over due to clumsiness by some of the earliest investors. 20% of Bitcoins are lost forever As we all know, increased scarcity, coupled with high demand always increases the market value of an asset. Whilst many people have their opinions on how Bitcoins market value will be affected, a mathematical prediction model paints a bullish picture of where Bitcoins price could be in the time following the halving. Statistical model predicts a fair value of $55,000 to $100,000 for Bitcoin with 95% accuracy In March 2019, an institutional investor based in Europe who goes by the name \"PlanB\", released a popular article on Medium titled  . Modeling Bitcoins Value with Scarcity The article contained the image below, which shows Bitcoins total market value over time, modelled using a linear regression. The linear regression model predicts a $55,000 to $100,000 price for Bitcoin, this is only 5x-10x, which if true would mean that Bitcoins value doesn\\'t even grow as much as it did after the previous halvings. This model proves what we all already know, that there\\'s a significant relationship between Bitcoins scarcity (stock-to-flow ratio of SF) and its market value. As you can see in the lower right corner of the model, this relationship has an R Squared (R2) of 95% (0.947328), showing a very high correlation between the two data points. (SF + Market Value) To help you better understand the above model, the following data points are represented as follows: Gold is represented using a large yellow circle Silver is represented using a large grey circle Bitcoin is represented by the small, rainbow coloured circles which encircle the black power regression line. The color of the Bitcoin dots are influenced by the \"months until halving\", which is indicted on the right hand side of the model. Okay, so Bitcoin\\'s value is driven by scarcity, we all knew that right? How is this information important? Well, as explained earlier, the Bitcoin halving reduces the block reward for mining by 50%. This means that Bitcoin miners will earn 50% less Bitcoins, cutting in half the amount of new Bitcoins that enter circulation. This event happens every 4 years and has already happened twice. The 2020 Bitcoin Halving will reduce the block reward from 12.5 Bitcoins per block to 6.25 Bitcoins. Now lets go back to the linear regression model. As you can see, as we get closer to the halving (referenced by the small dots shifting through green and blue) the market value of Bitcoin hovers between the $55,000 and $100,000 mark. This doesn\\'t however mean that Bitcoin will magically shoot up to $100k once the halving occurs. In fact by looking at historical data we can see that it actually takes much longer for Bitcoins value to grow exponentially after a halving: After the 2012 Bitcoin Halving, it took a year for Bitcoin to go from $11 to $1,100 in 2013. After the 2012 Bitcoin Halving, it took a year for Bitcoin to go from $600 to $20,000 in 2017. The FirstBitcoin Halving in 2012 The first Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28th 2012 when one BTC was worth around $11. A year later, bitcoins price surged to a mouth watering $1,100 in 2013, a price never before seen with Bitcoin. It had only been one year since the halving and Bitcoin had grown 100x. Bitcoins price eventually fell to around $220 and it remained below $1,000 for the next few years. Even at its bottom Bitcoin was still up 20x from its price before the halving. The Second BitcoinHalving in 2016 The second Bitcoin halving occurred during July 2016. Bitcoin maintained a price of around $600$700 before rising to $20,000 during the 2017 bull market. Bitcoin experienced a growth of over 33x from its price before the and over 1,818x from its price before the second halving first halving. Bitcoin\\'s recovery on the road to the 2020 halving The chart below shows how the value of Bitcoin has grown after every halving as well as the number of Bitcoins that will be generated during each 4 year period between the halvings. The chart above is courtesy of @ChartsBtc on Twitter. As we know, recently Bitcoin reached a price point of $10,000 on Thursday, the first time since February 24th and after a slump to $4,656 in March. What to expect from the Third Bitcoin Halving in 2020 according to Experts Well it is May 2020 and the halving is upon us so lets look at what some top experts have to say about how the halving will affect Bitcoin. Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell seems to be optimistic about Bitcoin reaching $100k after the halving. He believes Bitcoin will reach a price point of $100k or $1m. When I hear people talking about a bitcoin \"correction\" I\\'m thinking $100k, maybe $1m. That\\'s what\\'s correct. an investor based in the USA, was also bullish with a Anthony Pomp Pompliano, $100k Bitcoin price prediction by the end of 2021. With a fixed supply asset, as demand increases, we continue to see price appreciation. One of the largest drivers of that demand or increase in scarcity is the halving in May 2020 which I think is going to be a big moment and is about 18-19 months from the start of 2021. Anthony Pompliano continued to say: So I think that will be a big moment there and something that we see in the past that has caused a large appreciation in price. Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead seems very bullish, , he told them he expected a price target of half a million dollars. in a letter to investors in April If history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin would peak in August 2021  at $533,431. The overall sentiments appear to bullish but again they all seem to agree that Bitcoins price could grow gradually, like we have seen with the previous halvings. Final thoughts Personally, I feel that Bitcoins market value will follow historical trends and grow to a new high after about a year. The increased scarcity, increased awareness and adoption, coupled with previous halving occurrences make me positive about this. Secondly, the linear regression model seems to mirror the expectations of various experts, despite actually being more conservative with a $55k to $100k outcome. I suggest you buckle up and hang on, the next few years will be very interesting. I hope you enjoyed this s', 'snippet': 'It is currently May 2020 and the Third <b>Bitcoin</b> Halving is upon us.

According to analysts, the cryptocurrency might be in the process of creating a strong support at this level before resuming its ongoing bull run. As an illustration, the leading Altcoin has generated year-to-date gains of 29.28 percent relative to its current priceof $9,282.30.\\nBitcoin Not Invulnerable; Cryptocurrency Drops Near 2020s Low Following Oil Price War\\nAnalysts have pegged Bitcoins ongoing rise to a confluence of supporting factors, with the cryptocurrencys imminent halving event likely serving as a potent tailwind. As we have explainedpreviously, miners are currently awarded 12.5 Bitcoins for every block mined. These awards are cut in half every four years to keep a lid on the cryptocurrencys inflation with the mechanism being baked into the tokens underlying code. As soon as the 12th of May, the reward will be again cut in half  in what will be the third such halving event  to 6.25 new Bitcoins for every block mined.\\nSome of the most massive increases in Bitcoins price in the past have been preceded by these halving events. For instance, the premier token rose from $12 to over $1,000 in the 12 months that followed its first halving event in 2012. Similarly, the cut in mining reward in 2016 produced gains of 1,000 percent in its aftermath. According to the research by Pantera Capital, Bitcoins price usually plummets 459 days prior to the halving event. Subsequently, as the event approaches, the tokens price rises and then explodes higher thereafter. Moreover, these post-halving rallies usually last 446 days. Consequently, if the past precedent holds true this time around, Bitcoins price should peak in August 2021.\\nJeffries analyst, Christopher Wood, recently recommended the purchase of Bitcoins in his weekly Greed & Fear newsletter, notingthat:\\nTo invest in Bitcoin, it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited.\\nHe added that Bitcoin can serve as an effective hedge and a source of diversification precisely because of its truly decentralized nature.\\nAnother factor that may be supporting Bitcoins rise is the incessant growth in cryptocurrency wallets, which increased by 2 percentin April, marking the largest spike since November 2019.\\nA more astonishing bullish factor, however, maybe the recent predictionby the analyst PlanB in a 27th April blog post meant to introduce the third iteration of his stock-to-flow (S2F) model. According to the analyst, his model predicts that Bitcoins market capitalization will inflate to $5.5 trillion by 2024, corresponding to a token price of $288,000! As a refresher, S2F models determine the value of tokens by comparing the addition of new supply from mining with the existing volume in circulation  also known as the stock. Bear in mind that previous S2F analyses have predicted an average Bitcoin price of $100,000 by 2024. Nonetheless, as is the case with all models, readers should exercise caution and perform their own due diligence before blindly taking these predictions at their face value.\\nShare', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC), the pre-eminent cryptocurrency and the reigning heavyweight in the arena, seems poised for a historic bull run amid a confluence of ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-06T13:55:16', 'provider': {'name': 'wccftech', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9f4eee6a81182038f35baa39b9db15d0.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'wccftech', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://wccftech.com/bitcoin-btc-trying-to-establish-support-above-9000-just-days-before-the-crucial-halving-event-is-the-cryptocurrency-poised-to-hit-288000-by-2024/'}}, {'id': '6291590467836921339', 'title': 'Re: RFC: ship block chain 1-74000 with release tarballs?

The notion of quickly and seamlessly converting fiat into bitcoin in small, regular increments has lowered a perceived barrier that BTC investment requires large, single purchases and has encouraged Bitcoiners to build up their HODLings on a regular basis.\\nOf the handful of services that allow users to stack sats, FastBitcoinsmay be filling a unique niche. It offers in-person bitcoin buying in physical outlets, where users can directly convert their fiat cash into BTC. And, as of today, that service includes the ability to dollar-cost average their investments.\\nFrom today, registered FastBitcoins users can automatically buy bitcoins at a frequency of their choice, according to an announcement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The only thing they will need to do is ensure that their FastBitcoin account remains topped up with a sufficient cash balance. When a purchase is made, users receive an email from FastBitcoins confirming it and requesting a delivery address or Lightning invoice for their bitcoins to be delivered straight away.\\nDollar-cost averaging is a method of BTC investment that is growing in popularity alongside the stack sats movement. Rather than trying to time large BTC investments when its price is relatively high, the method allows investors to average their purchases and reduce the impact of volatility.\\nNew features such as automatic dollar-cost averaging gives users the ability to hold balances denominated in their local currencies and will ultimately allow them to have complete flexibility when purchasing bitcoins, said Danny Brewster, managing director of FastBitcoins, per the release. We also ensure users get delivery of their bitcoins straight away.\\nCritically, FastBitcoins will maintain its other advanced features as it integrates the new service and adapts to the European Unions Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) a set of rules that govern financial companies to ensure best practices for deterring money laundering, but pose unique challenges for private bitcoin investment and custody.\\nWe were able to incorporate these regulatory measures without compromising on user experience and our core principles, Brewster said. That means we remain a non-custodial exchange, and deliver bitcoins almost instantly to customers either on-chain or on the Lighting Network.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\nTrending Topics', 'snippet': 'So far, <b>Bitcoin</b> adoption in 2020 has been defined ... of quickly and seamlessly converting fiat into bitcoin in small, regular increments has lowered a ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-20T00:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1910600638', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'nasdaq', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastbitcoins-launches-dollar-cost-averaging-feature-2020-05-20'}}, {'id': '7767858121133787468', 'title': 'Bitcoin Is Leaving Banking Stocks in the Dust', 'url': 'https://www.geezwild.com/bitcoin-is-leaving-banking-stocks-in-the-dust/', 'description': 'Bitcoin (BTC) continues to outperform major U.S. banking stocks so far in 2020 despite seeing a massive sell-off in mid-March.

It is not possible to predict exactly how a world of negative interest rates will develop. However, it is clear that the very foundations of the system of international finance are coming under increasing strain.\\nIn this context, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and the unique attributes they possess can no longer be ignored by international investors. It is time to readjust your investment portfolio to the new market paradigm.\\nInflation: An Illusion\\nIt may not be visible or obvious but as the money supply increases with quantitative easing (QE), the value of fiat currency depreciates. Although our purchasing power regarding primary consumer goods doesnt seem to have changed much over the last 10 years (as reflected in the CPI), there are other factors that will hit us very hard. Unions and workers still exist today but workers, even as an economic aggregate, are replaced either by outsourcing the production to countries with cheaper labor and poorer working conditions or by centralised automation. Therefore, in an extremely competitive and well organized international market, we face the illusion that prices will never go up and inflation is not significant. On top of this, malicious practices such as built-in obsolescence have become the norm and although this doesnt impact the facing price of consumer goods but, by shortening our life expectancy, creates indirect inflation. But none of these factors have been taken into account with the vanity metrics coming from the CPI. The exact same negative spirale has been going on for over a century,\\nQuantitative Easing, Buybacks & Fiat Debasement: A Reality\\nOn the contrary, assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate are constantly heading north. As the economy became more and more leveraged through endless buybacks indicating that inflation can be observed and its dangerous. Approximately $60 trillion of US dollar denominated debt (demand) is held globally relative to a monetary base (supply) of around $4.5 trillion.\\nThis is only the beginning of aggressive central bank intervention. With global debt at $255 trillion or 322% of global GDP, its unlikely that these accommodative policies will ever be reversed. During the great financial crisis and over the course of 1.5 years, the Fed added $1.5 trillion to its balance sheet. In 2020, the Fed has printed over $2 trillion in less than 60 days!\\nWhen a massive amount of money like this is injected into the system, investors are looking to hedge themselves against the risk of monetary debasement and start to buy assets in limited supply: real estates, stocks, precious metals and more recently Bitcoin as a non-correlated asymmetric return asset.\\nBitcoin is controlled by no government or central entity and its quantitative tightening monetary policy is enforced by an algorithm that cant be reversed. It is an asset of unique characteristics in the current environment. To this point, and often misunderstood by traditional investors, Bitcoin is gaining in popularity among long term investors:\\nAsymmetric Distribution of Returns: Sustainability\\nThe essence of investment management, said by the legendary investor Benjamin Graham, is the management of risks, not the management of returns.\\nMarket Crashes of the past twenty years have led many investors to reexamine some of the key assumptions that lie at the heart of modern portfolio theory. The favorite topic of investment gurus Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Ray Dalio among others is portfolio management focusing on asymmetric returns (i.e investment strategies that maximize upside potential while capping downside risks) This has become the recipe for sustainable investment strategies.\\nWhen comparing the distribution of daily returns between Bitcoin and S&P 500, it is clear that the digital currency outclasses the performance of the 500 largest US companies by a far stretch. The recent market deep episode is a good illustration of that difference, as noticed by Bloomberg senior analyst Mike McGlone: Bitcoin is showing divergent strength versus the wobbly stock market, noting the cryptocurrencys rapid decline on March 12, when it plunged 27%. As for the record, BTC rose past $10,000 in early May, largely spurred by the impending halving.\\nAs shown in SwissBorg research or Binance research, over the course of the last 7 years, a portfolio composed of 50% of MSCI WORLD Index & 50% Core Total USD Bond Market can greatly improve its risk/return ratio by incorporating as little as 2% of Bitcoin in its allocation.\\nAnother interesting fact is that the correlation between Bitcoin and gold is now at a historical high, signaling that Bitcoin is now considered by international investors as a safe haven.\\nWith Bitcoin now up more than 100% off of its March 12th lows and a lagging recovery in the stock market, it is more than likely that Bitcoin follows the path of gold a few decades ago in becoming part of the international investors asset universe.\\nA final note  While Bitcoin halving events are important, it is still limited to a single and limited factor mainly impacting miners in the short-run. If we really want to understand bitcoins potential as money 2.0, it is important to understand the future devaluation and debasement of the major fiat currencies while taking into consideration all 5 of the players directly impacting the BTCs price action.\\nIf you believe in Bitcoins properties and potential, you can now buy BTC with', 'snippet': 'CityAM - <b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC) has been labeled as an uncorrelated asset since BTC is not directly connected to global GDP, company, revenues,.  also peaked ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-12T08:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8fb1fed8-dd83-4718-aee2-4f88a43161f3.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'cityam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.cityam.com/bitcoin-five-factors-one-conclusion-three-parts/'}}, {'id': '260303729041451090', 'title': 'Chinese Telecom Giant to Integrate Blockchain Technology Into 5G Systems', 'url': 'https://btcmanager.com/chinese-telecom-blockchain-technology-5g-systems/', 'description': 'China Telecom, a leading Chinese telecommunications company, has revealed that blockchain technology will be massively integrated into its 5G systems as the revolutionary tech behind bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins.

This will have the following implications: Miners will now receive only 50% of the Bitcoins as a block reward, earning 6.25 BTC after the halving instead of 12.5 BTC. Since the block reward will be halved, the number of Bitcoins entering circulation will be halved too. So now 6.25 Bitcoins will be created every 10 minutes for the next 4 years before being halved again. This means over the next 4 years, 1,312,500 Bitcoins will be produced and after the next halving (2024) only 656,250 Bitcoins will be generated until the 5th Bitcoin Halving in 2028. With the number of Bitcoins being generated every 10 minutes being cut in half, this will bring increased scarcity to the popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin  is already scarce due to its limited supply and the fact that over due to clumsiness by some of the earliest investors. 20% of Bitcoins are lost forever As we all know, increased scarcity, coupled with high demand always increases the market value of an asset. Whilst many people have their opinions on how Bitcoins market value will be affected, a mathematical prediction model paints a bullish picture of where Bitcoins price could be in the time following the halving. Statistical model predicts a fair value of $55,000 to $100,000 for Bitcoin with 95% accuracy In March 2019, an institutional investor based in Europe who goes by the name \"PlanB\", released a popular article on Medium titled  . Modeling Bitcoins Value with Scarcity The article contained the image below, which shows Bitcoins total market value over time, modelled using a linear regression. The linear regression model predicts a $55,000 to $100,000 price for Bitcoin, this is only 5x-10x, which if true would mean that Bitcoins value doesn\\'t even grow as much as it did after the previous halvings. This model proves what we all already know, that there\\'s a significant relationship between Bitcoins scarcity (stock-to-flow ratio of SF) and its market value. As you can see in the lower right corner of the model, this relationship has an R Squared (R2) of 95% (0.947328), showing a very high correlation between the two data points. (SF + Market Value) To help you better understand the above model, the following data points are represented as follows: Gold is represented using a large yellow circle Silver is represented using a large grey circle Bitcoin is represented by the small, rainbow coloured circles which encircle the black power regression line. The color of the Bitcoin dots are influenced by the \"months until halving\", which is indicted on the right hand side of the model. Okay, so Bitcoin\\'s value is driven by scarcity, we all knew that right? How is this information important? Well, as explained earlier, the Bitcoin halving reduces the block reward for mining by 50%. This means that Bitcoin miners will earn 50% less Bitcoins, cutting in half the amount of new Bitcoins that enter circulation. This event happens every 4 years and has already happened twice. The 2020 Bitcoin Halving will reduce the block reward from 12.5 Bitcoins per block to 6.25 Bitcoins. Now lets go back to the linear regression model. As you can see, as we get closer to the halving (referenced by the small dots shifting through green and blue) the market value of Bitcoin hovers between the $55,000 and $100,000 mark. This doesn\\'t however mean that Bitcoin will magically shoot up to $100k once the halving occurs. In fact by looking at historical data we can see that it actually takes much longer for Bitcoins value to grow exponentially after a halving: After the 2012 Bitcoin Halving, it took a year for Bitcoin to go from $11 to $1,100 in 2013. After the 2012 Bitcoin Halving, it took a year for Bitcoin to go from $600 to $20,000 in 2017. The FirstBitcoin Halving in 2012 The first Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28th 2012 when one BTC was worth around $11. A year later, bitcoins price surged to a mouth watering $1,100 in 2013, a price never before seen with Bitcoin. It had only been one year since the halving and Bitcoin had grown 100x. Bitcoins price eventually fell to around $220 and it remained below $1,000 for the next few years. Even at its bottom Bitcoin was still up 20x from its price before the halving. The Second BitcoinHalving in 2016 The second Bitcoin halving occurred during July 2016. Bitcoin maintained a price of around $600$700 before rising to $20,000 during the 2017 bull market. Bitcoin experienced a growth of over 33x from its price before the and over 1,818x from its price before the second halving first halving. Bitcoin\\'s recovery on the road to the 2020 halving The chart below shows how the value of Bitcoin has grown after every halving as well as the number of Bitcoins that will be generated during each 4 year period between the halvings. The chart above is courtesy of @ChartsBtc on Twitter. As we know, recently Bitcoin reached a price point of $10,000 on Thursday, the first time since February 24th and after a slump to $4,656 in March. What to expect from the Third Bitcoin Halving in 2020 according to Experts Well it is May 2020 and the halving is upon us so lets look at what some top experts have to say about how the halving will affect Bitcoin. Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell seems to be optimistic about Bitcoin reaching $100k after the halving. He believes Bitcoin will reach a price point of $100k or $1m. When I hear people talking about a bitcoin \"correction\" I\\'m thinking $100k, maybe $1m. That\\'s what\\'s correct. an investor based in the USA, was also bullish with a Anthony Pomp Pompliano, $100k Bitcoin price prediction by the end of 2021. With a fixed supply asset, as demand increases, we continue to see price appreciation. One of the largest drivers of that demand or increase in scarcity is the halving in May 2020 which I think is going to be a big moment and is about 18-19 months from the start of 2021. Anthony Pompliano continued to say: So I think that will be a big moment there and something that we see in the past that has caused a large appreciation in price. Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead seems very bullish, , he told them he expected a price target of half a million dollars. in a letter to investors in April If history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin would peak in August 2021  at $533,431. The overall sentiments appear to bullish but again they all seem to agree that Bitcoins price could grow gradually, like we have seen with the previous halvings. Final thoughts Personally, I feel that Bitcoins market value will follow historical trends and grow to a new high after about a year. The increased scarcity, increased awareness and adoption, coupled with previous halving occurrences make me positive about this. Secondly, the linear regression model seems to mirror the expectations of various experts, despite actually being more conservative with a $55k to $100k outcome. I suggest you buckle up and hang on, the next few years will be very interesting. I hope you enjoyed this s', 'snippet': 'It is currently May 2020 and the Third <b>Bitcoin</b> Halving is upon us.

According to analysts, the cryptocurrency might be in the process of creating a strong support at this level before resuming its ongoing bull run. As an illustration, the leading Altcoin has generated year-to-date gains of 29.28 percent relative to its current priceof $9,282.30.\\nBitcoin Not Invulnerable; Cryptocurrency Drops Near 2020s Low Following Oil Price War\\nAnalysts have pegged Bitcoins ongoing rise to a confluence of supporting factors, with the cryptocurrencys imminent halving event likely serving as a potent tailwind. As we have explainedpreviously, miners are currently awarded 12.5 Bitcoins for every block mined. These awards are cut in half every four years to keep a lid on the cryptocurrencys inflation with the mechanism being baked into the tokens underlying code. As soon as the 12th of May, the reward will be again cut in half  in what will be the third such halving event  to 6.25 new Bitcoins for every block mined.\\nSome of the most massive increases in Bitcoins price in the past have been preceded by these halving events. For instance, the premier token rose from $12 to over $1,000 in the 12 months that followed its first halving event in 2012. Similarly, the cut in mining reward in 2016 produced gains of 1,000 percent in its aftermath. According to the research by Pantera Capital, Bitcoins price usually plummets 459 days prior to the halving event. Subsequently, as the event approaches, the tokens price rises and then explodes higher thereafter. Moreover, these post-halving rallies usually last 446 days. Consequently, if the past precedent holds true this time around, Bitcoins price should peak in August 2021.\\nJeffries analyst, Christopher Wood, recently recommended the purchase of Bitcoins in his weekly Greed & Fear newsletter, notingthat:\\nTo invest in Bitcoin, it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited.\\nHe added that Bitcoin can serve as an effective hedge and a source of diversification precisely because of its truly decentralized nature.\\nAnother factor that may be supporting Bitcoins rise is the incessant growth in cryptocurrency wallets, which increased by 2 percentin April, marking the largest spike since November 2019.\\nA more astonishing bullish factor, however, maybe the recent predictionby the analyst PlanB in a 27th April blog post meant to introduce the third iteration of his stock-to-flow (S2F) model. According to the analyst, his model predicts that Bitcoins market capitalization will inflate to $5.5 trillion by 2024, corresponding to a token price of $288,000! As a refresher, S2F models determine the value of tokens by comparing the addition of new supply from mining with the existing volume in circulation  also known as the stock. Bear in mind that previous S2F analyses have predicted an average Bitcoin price of $100,000 by 2024. Nonetheless, as is the case with all models, readers should exercise caution and perform their own due diligence before blindly taking these predictions at their face value.\\nShare', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC), the pre-eminent cryptocurrency and the reigning heavyweight in the arena, seems poised for a historic bull run amid a confluence of ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-05-06T13:55:16', 'provider': {'name': 'wccftech', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9f4eee6a81182038f35baa39b9db15d0.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'wccftech', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://wccftech.com/bitcoin-btc-trying-to-establish-support-above-9000-just-days-before-the-crucial-halving-event-is-the-cryptocurrency-poised-to-hit-288000-by-2024/'}}, {'id': '6291590467836921339', 'title': 'Re: RFC: ship block chain 1-74000 with release tarballs?

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBitcoin Coin Trading\\nBitcoin can be traded on these cryptocurrency exchanges:  HitBTC,  Paribu,  InfinityCoin Exchange,  Coinbe,  FCoin,  BiteBTC,  BTC-Alpha,  OKEx,  Bitbank,  CoinTiger,  LATOKEN,  IDAX,  Tidex,  HADAX,  Bithumb,  Kucoin,  GOPAX,  Hotbit,  Cryptonex,  Allcoin,  Ovis,  ZB.COM,  Exrates,  Kraken,  BitBay,  MBAex,  Mercatox,  Coinsquare,  Bitfinex,  LocalTrade,  Negocie Coins,  TOPBTC,  CoinsBank,  Bitlish,  Coinsuper,  Bitsane,  Kryptono,  YoBit,  CoinEx,  Liquid,  DragonEX,  Korbit,  OOOBTC,  bitFlyer,  CoinBene,  Bitstamp,  itBit,  ChaoEX,  Bitinka,  Bit-Z,  IDCM,  BTCBOX,  Gate.io,  Bittrex,  Fatbtc,  Cobinhood,  Sistemkoin,  Iquant,  Cryptopia,  Exmo,  B2BX,  CoinEgg,  OEX,  Covesting,  Livecoin,  CPDAX,  QuadrigaCX,  BigONE,  LakeBTC,  Binance,  Coinone,  UEX,  Poloniex,  Coinbase Pro,  Coincheck,  DOBI trade,  BtcTrade.im,  Huobi,  LBank, BitForex,  Vebitcoin,  BitMart,  RightBTC,  Coinroom,  BCEX,  C2CX,  ABCC,  Coindeal,  DigiFinex,  Trade By Trade,  EXX,  Zaif,  Gemini,  Simex,  CEX.IO,  Coinhub,  Upbit,  xBTCe,  Bibox,  Instant Bitex and  BitMEX.

This essentially means traders can turn a profit regardless which direction the market moves in.\\nIt also includes basic spot exchange and credit card purchase functionality, for those looking for a less complex way to invest in cryptocurrencies.\\nCryptocurrency Derivatives are Taking Off\\nCryptocurrency derivatives exchanges have exploded in popularity in recent years, as cryptocurrency traders increasingly look to benefit from the trading advantages that are offered by derivatives products.\\nAmong these, the ability to trade with leverage makes futures trading a potentially lucrative exercise, since traders can multiply their exposure to market movements by up to 200x on StormGain, and up to 100x on competing platforms. As such, a normal market movement of 5% could yield as much as 1,000% profit if timed correctly. With that said, it is also possible to lose money just as fast, so its important to exercise caution and restraint when trading on leverage.\\nRecent estimates\\nindicate that the cryptocurrency derivatives industry might now exceed the Bitcoin spot volume by as much as 18 times, as an increasing proportion of traders look to use derivatives for both speculation and hedging purposes.\\nNow that new platforms are emerging to make cryptocurrency derivatives trading simpler and easier to access than ever before, it appears likely that 2020 will be a major tipping point for the industry for an industry that previously accessible to only the most advanced traders.\\nAbout The Author\\nCryptophile, Tech Geek, and an avid developer.\\nSearch Site', 'snippet': '... offers 10% APR on cryptocurrencies deposited on the platform, including <b>Bitcoin</b> (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) and XRP, beating out major ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-04-16T13:13:59', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-3.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/stormgain-wins-the-europeans-cryptocurrency-trading-and-exchange-platform-of-the-year-award/'}}, {'id': '3062207423590876094', 'title': \"Bitcoin's Value is Likely to Decrease Further as Demand Dwindles due to the Coronavirus  The Merkle News\", 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/bitcoins-value-is-likely-to-decrease-further-as-demand-dwindles-due-to-the-coronavirus/', 'description': 'Bitcoin is, according to Cobra, primarily purchased when users have an excess of cash.During the coronavirus crisis, that will be anything but the case.', 'body': \"There are many different opinions on whether Bitcoin should be considered a safe-haven asset or not.\\nCobra\\n, the co-founder of Bitcoin.org, certainly doesnt seem to be thinking along those lines.\\nMost Bitcoin enthusiasts are quite familiar with the name Cobra.\\nBitcoin Isnt a Safe-haven Asset, Cobra Claims\\nFor better or worse, this individual often shares personal thoughts and opinions on all aspects of Bitcoin.\\nRecently, he\\nthe worlds leading cryptocurrency shouldnt be considered to be a safe-haven asset during the coronavirus.\\nIt is a sentiment that many others share.\\nBitcoin is anything but a stable asset, and certainly remains linked to traditional market momentum.\\nCobra is convinced that cryptocurrencies are not a hedge against traditional finance.\\nNor will Bitcoin and other assets negate losses from a recession or stock market collapse.\\nIn that regard, the coronavirusmay have very negative effects on Bitcoin moving forward.\\nIt is an asset that, according to Cobra, is primarily purchased when users have an excess of cash.\\nDuring the coronavirus crisis, that will be anything but the case.\\nAs such, demand is likely to decrease, potentially driving prices down even further.\\nHow the Bitcoin halving will factor into all of this, remains to be determined.\\nEven so, the coming months will undoubtedly get very interesting.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com\\nJdebunt\\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

These dynamics might be interpreted as a reversal aimed at forming a new declining wave with the goal of 3925.70 USD. Note that it reached 50.0% Fibo, so a reversal looks quite natural. The descending dynamics of the MACD lines may be supporting the development of the declining wave.\\nOn H4, the picture of the trend reversal may be seen in more detail. Earlier, there formed a Black Cross in the overbought area of the Stochastic that warned of the end of growth. Currently, the quotations are forming the primary channel of the downtrend with the first aim at the support line near 6449.00 USD. Breaking this one away, the quotations will head for the mid-term level of 5480.00 USD. However, short sporadic growth should neither be excluded.

Headlines all over the financial press showed rampant fear across all markets as the everything bubble popped to the demise of fund managers everywhere. Many believed that bitcoin would be a suitable hedge against stocks, but it appears that while being correct in the long-run, traders and investors ultimately jumped the gun with overly high expectations.\\nHowever, all is not lost  far from it. Indeed, bitcoins network, hashing power, and sound money properties were there before the euphoric rises and subsequent market crash, and will continue to exist long after. In fact, bitcoins hashrate has just recovered by over 10% without needing any government bailout or helicopter money. Some have posited the prospect of miner capitulation after the drop, suggesting that more downside might be in the cards. However, the fact that the bitcoin hashrate experienced its second worst drop in difficult adjustment in history (15.8%), it could reasonably be said that capitulation already happened.\\nProvided the Internet and world infrastructure doesnt collapse, bitcoins immutable properties will remain and this will be reflected in the price, according to the architect of the S2F multiple, PlanB. Put simply, the industry-touted stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio measures bitcoins scarcity in order to predict the future price. Since Bitcoins inception, the model has been highly accurate and according to the designers estimates, should see bitcoin anywhere between $50,000-$100,000 sometime during 2021.\\nBreaking down stock to flow\\nBitcoins stock-to-flow ratio hypothesis was first\\nposted in March 2019\\n. The basic idea is that bitcoin is scarce and that this scarcity gives bitcoin value. Indeed, there will never be more than 21 million  18.2 million of which are already in circulation. This scarcity can also be seen in light of the concept of unforgeable costliness, which is the original cost of mining a bitcoin or precious metals. To this point, consider that an immense amount of electricity, expensive mining farms, labour, and time are required to mint fresh bitcoin, which gives the digital asset this permanent property. For instance, a study from September found that mining a bitcoin costs between\\n$5,100 and $8,500\\n. When the block halving event comes and goes in less than 40 days this unforgeable costliness will literally double, enforcing the claim of scarcity in the process.\\nOne way to measure the scarcity of any commodity is visa-vie the stock-to-flow ratio, which is the circulating supply of said commodity divided by the yearly production, i.e. the stock divided by the flow. Putting it all together, the stock-to-flow ratio is a projection of how many years it would take to double the circulating supply of a commodity.\\nAs can be expected, the phenomenon can be found elsewhere. In fact, gold has a stock-to-flow ratio of 62, the highest among precious metals. This means that it takes 62 years to double the gold supply. Similarly, silver has a S2F ratio of 22, making it more available than gold but still relatively scarce compared to palladium and platinum which have stock-to-flow ratios of 1.1 and 0.4 respectively. Essentially, such commodities arent scarce assets as they adapt with the market. For example, if the price of platinum rises, then production increases and thus pressures the market to return to its previous levels, nullifying any inflationary effect on the asset. Simply put, non-scarce commodities have stock-to-flow ratios near or below 1.\\nAt the time of writing, bitcoins stock-to-flow ratio stands at 26.9, which is calculated by dividing 18,211,000 BTCby the 657,000 coins mined each year. According to this model, bitcoin is already more scare than silver, with its next target being gold. In early May of this year, the block halving will surge to 56, bringing it closer to golds scarcity. Fast forward to 2024 and bitcoins S2F will have jumped to 120, making it even less available than most precious metals.\\nUnderstanding the mechanism behind the model\\nIn an attempt to deconstruct and understand the mechanisms behind Satoshis bitcoin, PlanB found that there was a statistically significant relationship between his model and the market capitalisation of a commodity. Since a higher S2F ratio is associated with a higher market capitalisation, PlanB anticipated that the upcoming halving would have a multiplier effect on bitcoins price, as it did with previous cycles. This power-law relationship coincided with previous block halvings, which is to say that a relative change in one quantity led to a proportional change in the other quantity, irrespective of the initial sizes. More specifically, PlanB found that with each cycle, bitcoins S2F ratio doubles post-halving, and the coins price surges by an order of magnitude. Notably, another revised efficient market hypothesis model projected bitcoin to be priced at $100,000 sometime after the big day.\\nThankfully, this statistic wasnt pulled out of thin air or some cavemans basement. Instead, a Twitter user by the name of bitstein created a Twitter bot called the S2F\\nMultiple\\nwhich automatically calculates the bitcoin price forecast over the next decade based on this ratio. When viewing the model, one can observe how apart from three occasions when the currency broke higher than the models projections, bitcoin retained its trajectory within the blue probability bands.\\nPerspective is no guarantee\\nWhile the model isnt useful for predicting bitcoins price at any given time, it allows people to get a better understanding about how bitcoins fundamental monetary policy could affect the market. Needless to say, while PlanB has stated that the model is indifferent to black swan events such as the one were witnessing right now, the reality is that nobody can be completely certain even if the theorising and modelling is accurate.  At the same time, bitcoins properties arent going away and the trillions of dollars in liquidity injections only serve to bolster arguments for sound money in a prospective free-market economy\\nAuthor Credit: Chris Attard, journalism and events specialist with an interest in bitcoin and crypto markets.\\nGet in touch at', 'snippet': 'S2F projections to send <b>bitcoin</b> to 6-digits?.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\\nBitcoin can be purchased on these cryptocurrency exchanges: Huobi, EXX, Cobinhood, CPDAX, GOPAX, Bittrex, LocalTrade, B2BX, Simex, Kryptono, IDCM, CoinsBank, Zaif, Coinsquare, Coinroom, Binance, CEX.IO, CoinEgg, Bit-Z, BtcTrade.im, RightBTC, Coinone, OEX, Bitinka, Fatbtc, Bitsane, Bibox, BitMEX, BitBay, FCoin, xBTCe, Coinbe, Bithumb, HADAX, BiteBTC, Sistemkoin, Hotbit, Instant Bitex, Liquid, OKEx, Kucoin, Coinhub, Exrates, DragonEX, Coincheck, ZB.COM, DOBI trade, Negocie Coins, BTCBOX, Mercatox, YoBit, Coinsuper, Gemini, Coinbase Pro, C2CX, Bitstamp, BitMart, Cryptonex, TOPBTC, Vebitcoin, IDAX, OOOBTC, MBAex, LATOKEN, Exmo, Allcoin, Livecoin, Cryptopia, Coindeal, Paribu, Trade By Trade, Covesting, ABCC, InfinityCoin Exchange, Korbit, ChaoEX, LakeBTC, UEX, LBank, CoinEx, Bitlish, Bitbank, HitBTC, bitFlyer, CoinTiger, Upbit, Poloniex, BTC-Alpha, Ovis, Gate.io, Kraken, itBit, BCEX, Tidex, BitForex, CoinBene, DigiFinex, Bitfinex, Iquant, QuadrigaCX and BigONE.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\\nBitcoin can be traded on these cryptocurrency exchanges: itBit, Cobinhood, LocalTrade, Exmo, Allcoin, Coindeal, bitFlyer, Coinbe, Trade By Trade, Vebitcoin, Mercatox, Coincheck, Instant Bitex, Gate.io, Bitbank, CEX.IO, BTC-Alpha, Coinone, Cryptopia, Bitinka, Hotbit, DragonEX, UEX, MBAex, Coinroom, InfinityCoin Exchange, YoBit, Livecoin, Ovis, BigONE, Coinhub, OOOBTC, LATOKEN, Binance, BitForex, BTCBOX, Coinbase Pro, ChaoEX, GOPAX, FCoin, Poloniex, Bit-Z, Liquid, EXX, Simex, Paribu, BCEX, Kucoin, Coinsuper, DOBI trade, CoinTiger, Bibox, IDCM, LBank, BitMEX, CoinBene, BiteBTC, Iquant, ABCC, HADAX, OKEx, BitBay, TOPBTC, Kryptono, Bithumb, Bitfinex, Kraken, Korbit, B2BX, Upbit, Bitsane, CPDAX, BitMart, OEX, Negocie Coins, Coinsquare, C2CX, CoinEgg, Fatbtc, Sistemkoin, IDAX, Bitlish, xBTCe, Tidex, Gemini, LakeBTC, Exrates, Zaif, DigiFinex, Bitstamp, ZB.COM, Huobi, Bittrex, Covesting, QuadrigaCX, BtcTrade.im, Cryptonex, RightBTC, CoinEx, HitBTC and CoinsBank.

However, the halving is not a prediction. Its a feature that was hard coded into Bitcoinin its inception, and its guaranteed to happen. The next halving will occur on 12 May 2020. While the timing of the halving is predictable, its impacts are quite unpredictable. Some people say it will cause Bitcoin prices to rise, others say it will cause prices to fall There are reasons to believe both. If you want the Bitcoin halving explained, and want a clear guide to how it may impact Bitcoin prices, this guide is for you.\\nGet The Full Series in PDF\\nGet the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.\\n\\nThe process explained\\nThere are currently about 18.3 million Bitcoin in existence, and new Bitcoin are entering the world at an average rate of 1,800 per day. This is Bitcoins issuance rate.\\nThe halving is when Bitcoins issuance rate gets cut in half. This means that in May 2020, the number of new Bitcoin being created will drop from 1,800 per day to 900 per day.\\nThe halving happens every few years. This will be Bitcoins fourth halving.\\nWhy the Bitcoin halving is important\\nOne way or another, the Bitcoin halving will be impactful. This is because newly created Bitcoin are given to Bitcoin miners. Its how they fund their operations and pay for all the equipment and electricity that goes into Bitcoin mining.\\nHowever, the margins on Bitcoin mining are usually quite thin, and its an extremely competitive industry. This means miners are constantly expanding their operations to the very edge of profitability. Consequently, any decrease in mining profitability can be very problematic for them.\\nThats what the halving will do, in a very big way. It will instantly cut profitability in half. Its an enormous, sudden change that completely changes the picture for mining.\\nThis means that one of the following things is 100% guaranteed to happen before or around 12 May 2020.\\nBitcoin prices rise enough to compensate for miners lost revenue.\\nA lot of Bitcoin miners will switch off their machines or go out of business.\\nA combination of both will happen, where Bitcoin prices rise a little bit, but miners still go out of business.\\nThe halving is a rare piece of certainty in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency Most Bitcoin predictions are hot air, but the above scenarios arent predictions, theyre facts. One of these three things is 100% guaranteed to happen in the next few months.\\nBut the question for anyone thinking of buying Bitcoinis whether this is more likely to make Bitcoin prices go up, or go down.\\nWhy the halving will make Bitcoin prices go up\\nSince its inception, a lot of people have tried to rationally work out a fair way of valuing Bitcoin. But there are very few models that can say something is fairly priced at both a single cent the way Bitcoin was in its early days, and at $10,000 the way Bitcoin was around the start of 2020.\\nOne of the few economic models that successfully accommodates this variation is called the stock to flow model\\nThe idea is that this model tells us what each Bitcoin should be worth. And as we can see, real life Bitcoin prices have tended to run very close to the price indicated by the stock to flow model.\\nSource:\\nhttps://s2f.hamal.nl/images/alltimeprice.png\\nThe stock to flow formula is very simple: the number of Bitcoin in existence divided by the number of new Bitcoin created each year.\\nThe answer is constantly changing, because the number of Bitcoin in existence (stock) is always increasing. But every few years, with each halving, Bitcoins issuance rate (flow) changes suddenly.\\nBitcoins stock to flow ratio immediately before the halving will be about 28. Its stock to flow ratio right after the halving will be 55.7.\\nThis means that, according to the stock to flow model, Bitcoins fair price quickly jumps from about US$10,000 to almost $100,000.\\nBut there are no guarantees, and there are also reasons to believe it will have the opposite effect, or that it will do nothing at all.\\nWhy the halving will make Bitcoin prices fall\\nHeres the question: if everyone actually believes in that stock to flow stuff, and actually expects Bitcoin to go to $100,000, why hasnt the market priced it in already?\\nThis is also why the halving could make Bitcoin prices drop. Its because people buy the rumour and sell the news.\\nIn other words, prices start rising in the run-up to the halving as people anticipate future rises and buy Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving. Then when the event actually occurs its a bit lacklustre, and people start selling.\\nWe saw this very clearly during the last halving which happened on 9 July 2016.\\nBitcoin prices almost doubled in the first half of 2016, leading up to the halving. But Bitcoin peaked at $750 the month before the halving, and then spent the next few months declining.\\nIn other words, even if the stock to flow theory is accurate, it doesnt apply immediately and prices tend to drop before it kicks in.\\nConclusion\\nOf course, this is only the fourth halving, and Bitcoin is in a different place today. Theres no guarantee that history will repeat, and a ten-fold Bitcoin price increase requires a lot more money than it used to. Were talking about trillions of dollars now, instead of just millions.\\nAnd if we look at other coins that also experience halvings, we can see that the halving doesnt magically equal a price increase. For example, Litecoinwent through the same process on 5 August 2019, with no discernible effect on price.\\nThe upshot of all this uncertainty is that it presents an excellent test of the stock to flow theory. One way or another, the next halving will be educational.', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b> halving explained and why it could make BTC prices fall.

The platform uses advanced tech equipment to enable its users to mint established blockchain-based virtual currencies like bitcoin, as well as numerous altcoins. Accordingly, it offers the cloud mining industry an easy, simple, and secure way to access cryptocurrencies and validate transaction data on the blockchain. Its watchword is\\nmining for everyone\\n.\\nThe Users Trust of Cloud Mining Services\\nCloud mining requires that the user trusts the cloud mining service to help them mine cryptocurrencies. The users goal is to reduce the cumbersome mining responsibilities, yet earn continuous profit from this mining activity. And that is why a secure platform that eliminates the difficulties and disadvantages of mining has to be used to achieve this goal.\\nTo that effect,\\nCrypto Mining\\nhas provided a reliable solution to the cloud mining industry. It ensures that users of its platform are saved from the task of setting up mining rigs, handling huge energy bills, and even dedicating an entire room for mining activity. For this reason, it becomes easier and faster to acquire cryptocurrencies.\\nCrypto Mining also takes security measures to ensure that its platform is not susceptible to hacks or manipulations. But thats not all! The company takes care of all activities pertaining to security, infrastructure, energy efficiency, insulation,  installation, device purchase-sale, and renewal to free the cloud mining community of information and operational burden.\\nCrypto Minings Infrastructure Impact on the Cloud Mining Industry\\nCrypto Minings secure infrastructure impacts significantly on the cloud mining industry. This impact is made possible through:\\n1. Advanced Technology Products:\\nCrypto Mining has several hashrate mining facilities installed in ideal locations across the world for access to security, heat, and energy. These strong and safe facilities are equipped with advanced technology products that make mining bitcoin and altcoins easy, seamless, and safe. Also, these state-of-the-art mining devices support the mining needs of 3 million users of the Crypto Mining platform.\\nThat being the case, beginners, enthusiastic, home miners, advanced miners, and large scale investors can use this platform to dig cryptocurrencies. The reason can be tied to the fact that Crypto Mining has already provided the basic tools needed to verify transactions on the blockchain. As a consequence, it takes away the need for the user to buy the speediest processor, or mining hardware to handle their mining activity.\\n2. User-friendly Interface:\\nA platform that is easy to use and navigate makes the task of mining stress-free. Moreover, theres no learning curve and as such, users can start using the full features of the platform upon registering. Consequently, Crypto Mining provides a cloud mining platform that can be used by new and existing investors in the crypto space.\\nAlso, the platform offers a high level of transparency where you can see all the details pertaining to your mining activity in real-time. Users are also provided with a return calculator, reports, and charts. The earning calculator, for instance, eliminates uncertainties as to how much a user can make from mining. Therefore, mining can be done more efficiently and effectively while dedicating minimum effort and time.\\n3. Flexibility:\\nA range of packages on the Crypto Mining platform ensures that the user finds one that is in their budget. Therefore, there are packages including beginner, intermediate, and professional. Each of these allows the user to share the hash power between an algorithm and a coin of their choice.\\nWhats more, the coins earned by the user reflects on their dashboard daily. And withdrawals of the total amount held in accounts can be made anytime the user chooses. A user of the cloud mining service can also decide to end their mining activity whenever. Therefore, Crypto Mining offers its users flexibility to control their mining operations as well as their funds.\\n4. Diverse Algorithms:\\nAll cryptocurrencies based on the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism are supported on this cloud mining service. As a consequence, users of Crypto Mining can dig virtual assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and ZCash, as well as their forked versions. The latter can be tied to the fact that different algorithms have been provided to handle the mining of different coins.\\nIt, therefore, follows that a user of Crypto Mining has the freedom to choose the coin they want to dig. They can mine Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, or select an altcoin of their choice. For instance, intermediate investors and professional investors on Crypto Minging can choose from 70 and 150 cryptocurrencies, respectively\\n5. Renewable Energy Sources:\\nWhile Crypto Minings aim is to enable its users to make a profit through mining, it also prioritizes the safety of the environment. For instance, crypto mining has been called harmful to the environment due to the pollution from power plants that supply energy to mining rigs. The process has also been called wasteful of resources given its high energy usage.\\nNonetheless, Crypto Mining mitigates the potential effects of mining activities through the use of renewable energy resources. In this case, wind and solar panels are installed in its facilities and natural cooling systems are used. This platform also partners with consultants and a research committee to curb carbon emissions and reduce fossil fuel use. Therefore, this is a platform for users who actively advocate for a sustainable environment.\\nConclusion\\nCrypto Mining provides the cloud mining industry with the best and safest infrastructure to handle the digging of coins. Its cutting-edge technology makes mining and blockchain technologies easily accessible to the general public. Accordingly, individuals and enterprises seeking a safe platform to generate cryptocurrencies need to take advantage of the tools offered on this platform.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': '... most innovative cloud mining services in the world has provided a secure and safe infrastructure for mining <b>bitcoin</b> (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-03-12T09:28:51', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_128207006.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/crypto-mining-revolutionizing-the-cloud-mining-industry-with-its-highly-secure-infrastructure/'}}, {'id': '8782925078083233683', 'title': 'XRP Has Not Stopped Falling  The Merkle Hash', 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/xrp-price-analysis-for-march-10th-xrp-has-not-stopped-falling/', 'description': 'On Tuesday, the XRP remains under pressure, trading at 0.2089 USD, though sales are not full-scale anymore.', 'body': 'RoboForex\\nOn Tuesday, the XRP remains under pressure, trading at 0.2089 USD, though sales are not full-scale anymore.\\nOn D1, the quotations tested the resistance area and kept declining.

According to him the power requirements for mining are too high and harm the ecology. On the other hand, Garlinghouse voice no such critics of the ETH because it is emitted by pre-mining.

Garlinghouse especially notes that no one assumes responsibility for it because the giants care for making money only.\\nIn the Telegraph publication it is said that on one BTC transaction, more energy is spent than an average British family spends in two months. According to the journalistic investigation, the possible consequences for the ecology may be compared to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by such a country as New Zealand.\\nIt is not the first time when the ecological consequences of mining are discussed.

Complete a captcha or look at and advertisement and you get one millionth of a BTC, that sort of thing. Youre never going to get rich off of one of them, but most people arent going to turn down free money either. The latest project from [TJ Bruno] follows that same conceptand brings it into the physical world. But you still arent going to get rich off of it.\\nThe hardware used for this corporeal Bitcoin Faucet is pretty simple. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and a 2.8 touch LCD. Naturally you could use a larger screen if you wanted, but then it wouldnt fit inside of the very slick 3D printed stand that [TJ] developed. We might consider upgrading to a slightly speedier Pi though, in the demonstration video it looks like the Zero is struggling pretty hard to handle the GUI.\\nUsing the Faucet is straightforward enough. You tap the screen and place a QR code representing your Bitcoin wallet on the devices tray, where its scanned by the camera. In a few seconds the Faucet shows a QR code on its own screen that will point your phones browser to the transaction details so you can verify your digital coinage is on the way.\\nYou might be wondering why youd want to have a device that sits there waiting to pay out fractions of a BTC to anyone whos willing to flash their wallet at it. Were not entirely sure, though it might make for an interesting way to raise awareness about cryptocurrency. In this particular case though, [TJ] says he was just looking for a project that would give him an excuse to hone his Python skills. Nothing wrong with that around these parts.\\nWatching the growth of cryptocurrency from our unique vantage point\\n, we can see how the hackers interest in Bitcoin as changed over the years. Where we once saw people excited about building custom mining rigs we now see counters that tick down as the last coins are put into circulation Looking at projects like this, it seems hackers are happy enough to just give the things away in an interesting way.\\nPosted in', 'snippet': 'For those unfamiliar with the term, a <b>Bitcoin</b> Faucet is usually used as an incentive in software that wants your attention.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\\nBitcoin can be traded on these cryptocurrency exchanges: itBit, Cobinhood, LocalTrade, Exmo, Allcoin, Coindeal, bitFlyer, Coinbe, Trade By Trade, Vebitcoin, Mercatox, Coincheck, Instant Bitex, Gate.io, Bitbank, CEX.IO, BTC-Alpha, Coinone, Cryptopia, Bitinka, Hotbit, DragonEX, UEX, MBAex, Coinroom, InfinityCoin Exchange, YoBit, Livecoin, Ovis, BigONE, Coinhub, OOOBTC, LATOKEN, Binance, BitForex, BTCBOX, Coinbase Pro, ChaoEX, GOPAX, FCoin, Poloniex, Bit-Z, Liquid, EXX, Simex, Paribu, BCEX, Kucoin, Coinsuper, DOBI trade, CoinTiger, Bibox, IDCM, LBank, BitMEX, CoinBene, BiteBTC, Iquant, ABCC, HADAX, OKEx, BitBay, TOPBTC, Kryptono, Bithumb, Bitfinex, Kraken, Korbit, B2BX, Upbit, Bitsane, CPDAX, BitMart, OEX, Negocie Coins, Coinsquare, C2CX, CoinEgg, Fatbtc, Sistemkoin, IDAX, Bitlish, xBTCe, Tidex, Gemini, LakeBTC, Exrates, Zaif, DigiFinex, Bitstamp, ZB.COM, Huobi, Bittrex, Covesting, QuadrigaCX, BtcTrade.im, Cryptonex, RightBTC, CoinEx, HitBTC and CoinsBank.

However, the halving is not a prediction. Its a feature that was hard coded into Bitcoinin its inception, and its guaranteed to happen. The next halving will occur on 12 May 2020. While the timing of the halving is predictable, its impacts are quite unpredictable. Some people say it will cause Bitcoin prices to rise, others say it will cause prices to fall There are reasons to believe both. If you want the Bitcoin halving explained, and want a clear guide to how it may impact Bitcoin prices, this guide is for you.\\nGet The Full Series in PDF\\nGet the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.\\n\\nThe process explained\\nThere are currently about 18.3 million Bitcoin in existence, and new Bitcoin are entering the world at an average rate of 1,800 per day. This is Bitcoins issuance rate.\\nThe halving is when Bitcoins issuance rate gets cut in half. This means that in May 2020, the number of new Bitcoin being created will drop from 1,800 per day to 900 per day.\\nThe halving happens every few years. This will be Bitcoins fourth halving.\\nWhy the Bitcoin halving is important\\nOne way or another, the Bitcoin halving will be impactful. This is because newly created Bitcoin are given to Bitcoin miners. Its how they fund their operations and pay for all the equipment and electricity that goes into Bitcoin mining.\\nHowever, the margins on Bitcoin mining are usually quite thin, and its an extremely competitive industry. This means miners are constantly expanding their operations to the very edge of profitability. Consequently, any decrease in mining profitability can be very problematic for them.\\nThats what the halving will do, in a very big way. It will instantly cut profitability in half. Its an enormous, sudden change that completely changes the picture for mining.\\nThis means that one of the following things is 100% guaranteed to happen before or around 12 May 2020.\\nBitcoin prices rise enough to compensate for miners lost revenue.\\nA lot of Bitcoin miners will switch off their machines or go out of business.\\nA combination of both will happen, where Bitcoin prices rise a little bit, but miners still go out of business.\\nThe halving is a rare piece of certainty in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency Most Bitcoin predictions are hot air, but the above scenarios arent predictions, theyre facts. One of these three things is 100% guaranteed to happen in the next few months.\\nBut the question for anyone thinking of buying Bitcoinis whether this is more likely to make Bitcoin prices go up, or go down.\\nWhy the halving will make Bitcoin prices go up\\nSince its inception, a lot of people have tried to rationally work out a fair way of valuing Bitcoin. But there are very few models that can say something is fairly priced at both a single cent the way Bitcoin was in its early days, and at $10,000 the way Bitcoin was around the start of 2020.\\nOne of the few economic models that successfully accommodates this variation is called the stock to flow model\\nThe idea is that this model tells us what each Bitcoin should be worth. And as we can see, real life Bitcoin prices have tended to run very close to the price indicated by the stock to flow model.\\nSource:\\nhttps://s2f.hamal.nl/images/alltimeprice.png\\nThe stock to flow formula is very simple: the number of Bitcoin in existence divided by the number of new Bitcoin created each year.\\nThe answer is constantly changing, because the number of Bitcoin in existence (stock) is always increasing. But every few years, with each halving, Bitcoins issuance rate (flow) changes suddenly.\\nBitcoins stock to flow ratio immediately before the halving will be about 28. Its stock to flow ratio right after the halving will be 55.7.\\nThis means that, according to the stock to flow model, Bitcoins fair price quickly jumps from about US$10,000 to almost $100,000.\\nBut there are no guarantees, and there are also reasons to believe it will have the opposite effect, or that it will do nothing at all.\\nWhy the halving will make Bitcoin prices fall\\nHeres the question: if everyone actually believes in that stock to flow stuff, and actually expects Bitcoin to go to $100,000, why hasnt the market priced it in already?\\nThis is also why the halving could make Bitcoin prices drop. Its because people buy the rumour and sell the news.\\nIn other words, prices start rising in the run-up to the halving as people anticipate future rises and buy Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving. Then when the event actually occurs its a bit lacklustre, and people start selling.\\nWe saw this very clearly during the last halving which happened on 9 July 2016.\\nBitcoin prices almost doubled in the first half of 2016, leading up to the halving. But Bitcoin peaked at $750 the month before the halving, and then spent the next few months declining.\\nIn other words, even if the stock to flow theory is accurate, it doesnt apply immediately and prices tend to drop before it kicks in.\\nConclusion\\nOf course, this is only the fourth halving, and Bitcoin is in a different place today. Theres no guarantee that history will repeat, and a ten-fold Bitcoin price increase requires a lot more money than it used to. Were talking about trillions of dollars now, instead of just millions.\\nAnd if we look at other coins that also experience halvings, we can see that the halving doesnt magically equal a price increase. For example, Litecoinwent through the same process on 5 August 2019, with no discernible effect on price.\\nThe upshot of all this uncertainty is that it presents an excellent test of the stock to flow theory. One way or another, the next halving will be educational.', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b> halving explained and why it could make BTC prices fall.

The platform uses advanced tech equipment to enable its users to mint established blockchain-based virtual currencies like bitcoin, as well as numerous altcoins. Accordingly, it offers the cloud mining industry an easy, simple, and secure way to access cryptocurrencies and validate transaction data on the blockchain. Its watchword is\\nmining for everyone\\n.\\nThe Users Trust of Cloud Mining Services\\nCloud mining requires that the user trusts the cloud mining service to help them mine cryptocurrencies. The users goal is to reduce the cumbersome mining responsibilities, yet earn continuous profit from this mining activity. And that is why a secure platform that eliminates the difficulties and disadvantages of mining has to be used to achieve this goal.\\nTo that effect,\\nCrypto Mining\\nhas provided a reliable solution to the cloud mining industry. It ensures that users of its platform are saved from the task of setting up mining rigs, handling huge energy bills, and even dedicating an entire room for mining activity. For this reason, it becomes easier and faster to acquire cryptocurrencies.\\nCrypto Mining also takes security measures to ensure that its platform is not susceptible to hacks or manipulations. But thats not all! The company takes care of all activities pertaining to security, infrastructure, energy efficiency, insulation,  installation, device purchase-sale, and renewal to free the cloud mining community of information and operational burden.\\nCrypto Minings Infrastructure Impact on the Cloud Mining Industry\\nCrypto Minings secure infrastructure impacts significantly on the cloud mining industry. This impact is made possible through:\\n1. Advanced Technology Products:\\nCrypto Mining has several hashrate mining facilities installed in ideal locations across the world for access to security, heat, and energy. These strong and safe facilities are equipped with advanced technology products that make mining bitcoin and altcoins easy, seamless, and safe. Also, these state-of-the-art mining devices support the mining needs of 3 million users of the Crypto Mining platform.\\nThat being the case, beginners, enthusiastic, home miners, advanced miners, and large scale investors can use this platform to dig cryptocurrencies. The reason can be tied to the fact that Crypto Mining has already provided the basic tools needed to verify transactions on the blockchain. As a consequence, it takes away the need for the user to buy the speediest processor, or mining hardware to handle their mining activity.\\n2. User-friendly Interface:\\nA platform that is easy to use and navigate makes the task of mining stress-free. Moreover, theres no learning curve and as such, users can start using the full features of the platform upon registering. Consequently, Crypto Mining provides a cloud mining platform that can be used by new and existing investors in the crypto space.\\nAlso, the platform offers a high level of transparency where you can see all the details pertaining to your mining activity in real-time. Users are also provided with a return calculator, reports, and charts. The earning calculator, for instance, eliminates uncertainties as to how much a user can make from mining. Therefore, mining can be done more efficiently and effectively while dedicating minimum effort and time.\\n3. Flexibility:\\nA range of packages on the Crypto Mining platform ensures that the user finds one that is in their budget. Therefore, there are packages including beginner, intermediate, and professional. Each of these allows the user to share the hash power between an algorithm and a coin of their choice.\\nWhats more, the coins earned by the user reflects on their dashboard daily. And withdrawals of the total amount held in accounts can be made anytime the user chooses. A user of the cloud mining service can also decide to end their mining activity whenever. Therefore, Crypto Mining offers its users flexibility to control their mining operations as well as their funds.\\n4. Diverse Algorithms:\\nAll cryptocurrencies based on the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism are supported on this cloud mining service. As a consequence, users of Crypto Mining can dig virtual assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and ZCash, as well as their forked versions. The latter can be tied to the fact that different algorithms have been provided to handle the mining of different coins.\\nIt, therefore, follows that a user of Crypto Mining has the freedom to choose the coin they want to dig. They can mine Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, or select an altcoin of their choice. For instance, intermediate investors and professional investors on Crypto Minging can choose from 70 and 150 cryptocurrencies, respectively\\n5. Renewable Energy Sources:\\nWhile Crypto Minings aim is to enable its users to make a profit through mining, it also prioritizes the safety of the environment. For instance, crypto mining has been called harmful to the environment due to the pollution from power plants that supply energy to mining rigs. The process has also been called wasteful of resources given its high energy usage.\\nNonetheless, Crypto Mining mitigates the potential effects of mining activities through the use of renewable energy resources. In this case, wind and solar panels are installed in its facilities and natural cooling systems are used. This platform also partners with consultants and a research committee to curb carbon emissions and reduce fossil fuel use. Therefore, this is a platform for users who actively advocate for a sustainable environment.\\nConclusion\\nCrypto Mining provides the cloud mining industry with the best and safest infrastructure to handle the digging of coins. Its cutting-edge technology makes mining and blockchain technologies easily accessible to the general public. Accordingly, individuals and enterprises seeking a safe platform to generate cryptocurrencies need to take advantage of the tools offered on this platform.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': '... most innovative cloud mining services in the world has provided a secure and safe infrastructure for mining <b>bitcoin</b> (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-03-12T09:28:51', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_128207006.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/crypto-mining-revolutionizing-the-cloud-mining-industry-with-its-highly-secure-infrastructure/'}}, {'id': '8782925078083233683', 'title': 'XRP Has Not Stopped Falling  The Merkle Hash', 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/xrp-price-analysis-for-march-10th-xrp-has-not-stopped-falling/', 'description': 'On Tuesday, the XRP remains under pressure, trading at 0.2089 USD, though sales are not full-scale anymore.', 'body': 'RoboForex\\nOn Tuesday, the XRP remains under pressure, trading at 0.2089 USD, though sales are not full-scale anymore.\\nOn D1, the quotations tested the resistance area and kept declining.

Complete a captcha or look at and advertisement and you get one millionth of a BTC, that sort of thing. Youre never going to get rich off of one of them, but most people arent going to turn down free money either. The latest project from [TJ Bruno] follows that same conceptand brings it into the physical world. But you still arent going to get rich off of it.\\nThe hardware used for this corporeal Bitcoin Faucet is pretty simple. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and a 2.8 touch LCD. Naturally you could use a larger screen if you wanted, but then it wouldnt fit inside of the very slick 3D printed stand that [TJ] developed. We might consider upgrading to a slightly speedier Pi though, in the demonstration video it looks like the Zero is struggling pretty hard to handle the GUI.\\nUsing the Faucet is straightforward enough. You tap the screen and place a QR code representing your Bitcoin wallet on the devices tray, where its scanned by the camera. In a few seconds the Faucet shows a QR code on its own screen that will point your phones browser to the transaction details so you can verify your digital coinage is on the way.\\nYou might be wondering why youd want to have a device that sits there waiting to pay out fractions of a BTC to anyone whos willing to flash their wallet at it. Were not entirely sure, though it might make for an interesting way to raise awareness about cryptocurrency. In this particular case though, [TJ] says he was just looking for a project that would give him an excuse to hone his Python skills. Nothing wrong with that around these parts.\\nWatching the growth of cryptocurrency from our unique vantage point\\n, we can see how the hackers interest in Bitcoin as changed over the years. Where we once saw people excited about building custom mining rigs we now see counters that tick down as the last coins are put into circulation Looking at projects like this, it seems hackers are happy enough to just give the things away in an interesting way.\\nPosted in', 'snippet': 'For those unfamiliar with the term, a <b>Bitcoin</b> Faucet is usually used as an incentive in software that wants your attention.

Its safe to say that after 10 years, cryptocurrencies havent hit the mainstream market yet but key players in the industry are still trying.\\nIn 2017, many turned their attention to cryptocurrencies because of their value. At some point in that year, a Bitcoin was valued at 20,000 US dollars and that made quite a noise. Many people have started to look into the industrys direction and thats why businesses have to come up with interesting ways to get more people involved.\\nThats when crypto gaming rally came about. It was when CryptoKitties came out. Its a blockchain game for Ethereum users created by Axiom Zen that enables players to buy, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats. Its one of the first innovations that made cryptocurrencies available for recreation and leisure.\\nIt was a hit as when this came out, many\\npeople started to use cryptos\\n. Since this is Ethereum-based, transactions on Ethereum have increased sixfold because of this game. Ethereum got around 15 percent more of the total traffic that it usually has gotten before CryptoKitties.\\nIts solid proof that gaming is an effective way to promote the use of cryptocurrencies. It just makes sense why more games similar to CryptoKitties were soon developed. However, that was in 2017 and this year, crypto gaming is set to become better.\\nTodays generation appears to be fonder of playing games and also doing this online or with their mobile devices. You can see how many mobile games there are right now and even gambling is prominent in the mobile sector.\\nMobile gambling appears to be a great way to promote cryptocurrencies. In fact, there are now online casinos that are focused on cryptocurrency users. You can check Nostrabet.com to see which online casinos have cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment for a deposit like the\\n1xbet app\\n.\\nThe number of mobile users worldwide have already reached around 4 billion and this may continue to grow in the next few years. This just means that reaching out to the mobile market may be the focus of the cryptocurrency industry and it makes a lot of sense.\\nTokenization is also a trend that comes with the rise of\\ncrypto gaming\\n. Virtual in-game currencies are now tokenized based on a blockchain network and attributing value. This allows game assets to be bought, sold, and also traded outside of the game.\\nGamers can eventually earn virtual currencies that can be tradable to crypto or virtual assets. Its simply a good business idea as it is basically giving players incentives that could promote or get people to play more.\\nCrypto-gambling can also change in the future. MintDice is bringing in trust and\\ninvestment opportunities\\nto its players. It has a few investment opportunities that are available for its players. MintDice simply wants to allow players to also capitalize on the success of their business.\\nThe company now offers risk-free Masternode/Staking investment opportunities. This means that players can cheaply invest in shared masternode pools and receive payouts based on the casinos profits and the amount of their investment.\\nAnother option is to allow the investor to be the bank. This is a form of a\\nrisk-free investment\\nso it could guarantee a revenue payout with no risks. The players can get 15 percent of the bets placed on the site, but this will still relate as to how much the player holds on the platform.\\nWhat MintDice is doing is quite revolutionary for the crypto gaming and gambling community and it is possible that more online casinos will pick something up from this.\\nRecently, a Houston-based gaming startup also got the attention of many as it prepares to release a card game based on cryptocurrencies. This is the first-ever cryptocurrency-themed card game and the company hopes to make crypto users more excited and convert card game lovers to crypto users.\\nCrypto Tycoon is what the card game is called and it is set to be released in March of this year. This can be played by two to five people who will be tasked to complete portfolios for three cryptocurrencies. Based on reviews of people who have already tried it, its a refreshing game thats easy to get a grip of.\\nJust think of how Monopoly helped normalized the idea of monopolistic capitalism. Crypto Tycoon may help more people understand how decentralization and cryptocurrencies work.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': 'At some point in that year, a <b>Bitcoin</b> was valued at 20,000 US dollars and that made quite a noise.

Currently, we still cant say that it has already reached the mainstream market, but many still see its potential. In the next years, it is expected that more people will be using cryptocurrencies to transact online.\\nIt was really in 2017 when many have started to take notice of Bitcoin and other altcoins like Ethereum, DogeCoin, LiteCoin, Ripple, and etc. During this year, Bitcoins value peaked at 20,000 US dollars. This made quite the noise and many people and businesses have started to take cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment.\\nDefinitely, the rise of cryptocurrencies has affected many online businesses positively. An example is the online gambling industry which includes online casinos and sportsbooks. Many have decided on using cryptos to gamble as it lets them avoid the hassle that banks would give them in terms of transactions that concern gambling.\\nAnonymity is also something that many punters and players get from using cryptos. It makes their\\ntransactions feel safer as using cryptos\\nmeans that you no longer need to disclose your banking information to the casino just so you can make a deposit.\\nThis also makes online betting and gambling easier for many people in the US. Many of the US players are placing bets on offshore-based casinos. Especially the ones who are residing in the states where online casinos and betting are still found illegal.\\nFederally, online casino gaming and betting arent illegal as long as the bets are placed outside the US. However, this can be quite risky as jurisdictions, where these casinos are licensed, are different. This means that it can be a bit tough if these players encounter any problems.\\nThe best that they can do is check online casino review sites like SilentBet. It has the information that you need to determine how well an online casino or bookie is doing. This site has reviews on many online casinos and bookies like\\nLibrabet\\nthat are worth checking out. It lets you know whether an online bookie or casino accepts cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\\nAside from businesses and consumers seeing the potential of cryptocurrencies, governments in different countries also started to take a look at it. This still means, however, that it took around 10 years for regulators to notice cryptocurrencies.\\nWe can say that they have already seen cryptos even before 2017, but it was really when more people started to get into it because of its value and potential value that some regulators started to take actions about it.\\nAn example is the recently implemented\\nEU law\\ncalled the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive of the AMLD5. This isnt exactly a directive that only focuses on cryptocurrencies but it would have quite an effect on the industry.\\nThere are two ways that this particular directive can affect crypto businesses. One effect is seen negatively but this could be mainly for smaller firms. The directive basically requires crypto-businesses to comply with regulations that could actually cost more money. This can be a problem for small firms as its possible that they cant afford it and they will either have to close or get involved in an acquisition.\\nNow, thats a problem that can take place in the early stages, but the thing is that this can also have a\\npositive effect on the industry\\n. This can be seen as a chance for crypto businesses to prove that the industry is serious about real solutions.\\nThis can be a chance to let regulators focus on the positive side of the industry instead of the negative possible uses of cryptos that critics would point out like how it can be used for fraudulent and money-laundering activities.\\nThe stability of cryptocurrencies can also be positively affected by this in the long run. The value of cryptos really depends on what the public and investors think of it. An example is how the value of Bitcoin plummeted when South Korea announced its ban on the country.\\nThe same happened when China chose to do the same thing. The value of Bitcoin also significantly decreased after these countries didnt want to deal with cryptos. However, when these countries announced that they chose to regulate its use instead, Bitcoins value then increased.\\nThis just shows that regulations could positively impact the value of cryptos because it may mean that more people or investors would invest in it. Overall, a proper regulatory framework can make the industry stronger and so thats something to be hopeful for. Its better than trying to avoid regulators touch the industry.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': 'Cryptocurrencies, particularly <b>Bitcoin</b>, have been around for over 10 years now.

Its launch date was January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoins total supply is 18,233,287 coins. Bitcoins official Twitter account is @bitcoinand its Facebook page is accessible here The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoinand the currencys Github account can be viewed here The official message board for Bitcoin is bitcointalk.org\\nAccording to CryptoCompare, Balances  block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions  private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing  mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.\\nBitcoin Coin Trading\\nBitcoin can be purchased on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: CoinTiger, Coinroom, ZB.COM, DOBI trade, Bithumb, Bit-Z, RightBTC, Kraken, CoinEgg, Mercatox, TOPBTC, Allcoin, Kucoin, HitBTC, Instant Bitex, CPDAX, Bitsane, EXX, Simex, LATOKEN, Paribu, Bibox, Sistemkoin, OEX, BCEX, Ovis, CoinBene, BitMEX, Coinsuper, ChaoEX, Coinbase Pro, MBAex, Bitstamp, Korbit, Bitinka, LakeBTC, Bitlish, DragonEX, HADAX, Coincheck, BiteBTC, BigONE, IDCM, LBank, Liquid, Tidex, Coinsquare, ABCC, Bitfinex, YoBit, Exrates, B2BX, BtcTrade.im, Huobi, bitFlyer, Negocie Coins, QuadrigaCX, Vebitcoin, BTC-Alpha, Zaif, Kryptono, C2CX, Gemini, FCoin, BitBay, CEX.IO, Cryptonex, CoinsBank, Bitbank, Poloniex, CoinEx, GOPAX, UEX, Gate.io, Coinone, xBTCe, BitForex, Exmo, Iquant, DigiFinex, Upbit, Trade By Trade, Coinhub, Cobinhood, LocalTrade, Hotbit, BTCBOX, Fatbtc, IDAX, Cryptopia, Coindeal, Binance, Coinbe, Bittrex, InfinityCoin Exchange, OKEx, Covesting, Livecoin, itBit, BitMart and OOOBTC.

I highly recommend reading this\\nForbes article\\non the topic as it should shed some light on the differences between Ripple and XRP, its use case and the general benefits that the products bring to the market. It should come as a shock to no one that control over cryptocurrency by governments is a serious concern  if that does happen, XRP seems to be in the best position politically to survive. Ripple is all above-board and has working relationships with many big players in the finance industry, including multiple banks around the world. The threat of control and restrictions by the powers that be can be offset slightly by selecting a cryptocurrency that would seem to be able to stand up against all scrutiny thrown its way.\\n#4  Ethereum\\nThere are lots of use cases for Ethereum  the most obvious one being ICOs. You only have to listen to Vitalik talking for a few minutes to realize that this is exactly the type of person whos going to ensure the long-term stability and future of his project, even if he takes a hands-off approach to its development. Ethereums relatively low-cost fees (such that people dont even really factor it in) and speedy transfer rates make it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin. Its also easier to play around with and understand, since the concept of wallets is a lot more developed and less prone to attacks. I personally believe that Ethereum is likely to sit behind Bitcoin for a long time to come  it just has something about it that gives off the impression its going to be around forever! Much like\\nand his review platform.\\n#5  VeChain\\nFocused on supply chain management, VeChain is a coin thats big in China and has plenty of active products and projects that are actually being used to verify goods and speed up the logistical side of international trade. VeChain originally began in 2015 and has gone from straight to strength ever since. It also has a masternode system in place, which stabilizes the price of the coin and the project in general as people invest for the long-term gains. It stands to reason that if people are willing to lock up tokens for passive revenue, its likely because VeChain has a promising future ahead of itself!\\nFinal thoughts on long-term investing in crypto\\nYou might not want to invest in every single currency listed above, but if you want a buy and forget approach, picking 3 out of the tokens above is a good starting point. The more diverse your holdings, the less risk you have. I should probably mention that I hold all 5 of the tokens above  thats for a good reason, though. Theyre great tokens! Anyhow, Im going to go and check out the\\nto spend all of my gains I made this week from trading  take care and happy investing!\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': '... relatively low-cost fees (such that people dont even really factor it in) and speedy transfer rates make it an attractive alternative to <b>Bitcoin</b>.', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-02-21T10:21:47', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_715169623.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/five-long-term-cryptocurrencies-to-consider/'}}, {'id': '4332496704262291373', 'title': 'bitcoin for beginners on Apple Podcasts', 'url': 'https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/supermoney-bitcoin-for-beginners/id1492340297', 'description': \"i'm not like a regular bitcoin podcast. i'm a cool bitcoin podcast.\", 'body': \"episode 3 - bitcoin in crisis\\nepisode 3 - bitcoin in crisis\\nThis episode looks at the scandals of Silk Road and Quadriga, and explores lessons learned from each.

Because if you want people to give up their bitcoin, youd better have a damn good reason. Microsoft and other companies that accept BTC dont currently have that. When you currently spend BTC on something from Microsoft, you arent getting any additional financial benefit of using that payment method versus a credit card, especially in the U.S. where using BTC for purchases is a tax nightmare. The typical case for spending BTC versus fiat is usually about adoption to encourage more merchants to accept BTC. In a lot of cases, that incentive isnt strong enough for many HODLers.\\nNonprofits are a completely different story. Donations of BTC are not a taxable event. Not only do you not incur capital gains tax, but its also a tax write-off on your tax return. Plus, donations still have the added benefit of spreading adoption since they also have powerful social media armies to spread the word. Heres why nonprofits will lead the adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2020.\\nIncentivized: Nonprofits Need to Accept Bitcoin Donations\\nNonprofits are accepting bitcoin donations. This is the result of a powerful incentive: taxes. Since the the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has classified bitcoin as property, that means it's similar to donating stock  but in the case of bitcoin, the process is much easier. This incentive is already proving to be stronger for bitcoin than it is for stocks, as donate bitcoin has been searched more than donate stocks on Google over the last five years.\\nSource:\\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=donate%20bitcoin,donate%20stocks\\nFor the donor, when they donate appreciated bitcoin to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, they do not have to pay capital gains and can write it off on their taxes. Bitcoin donations are not taxable events for the donor or the nonprofit, allowing people to contribute 20-30 percent more, depending on their tax bracket. Thats why over just the last few years weve seen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin donations sent to nonprofits, particularly during bull markets. Some of this was fueled by major donors like the infamous Pineapple Fundthat donated $56 million worth of bitcoin to 60 different charities.\\nIf you were going to donate fiat to a nonprofit this year, consider donating bitcoin instead. If the bitcoin has appreciated, this is likely a more tax efficient way of supporting your favorite causes. Plus, you can even redirect the fiat you were planning to donate and just repurchase the same amount of BTC after the donation, so you can keep stacking sats.\\nVocal: When Nonprofits Talk About Bitcoin, People Listen\\nNonprofits often have larger and more engaged audiences than major corporations. Take Save the Children, for example. They have almost 3 million Twitter followers and a budget of over $800 million per year  more than most for-profit companies. Thats why people are increasingly excited about major nonprofits entering the space. A $1 million fiat donation isnt a story. A $1 million donation in bitcoin is still a story.\\nActive: Nonprofits Are Already Accepting Bitcoin Donations\\nOver the last year, the number of nonprofits accepting bitcoin or other cryptocurrency donations has doubled.

The Court granted the injunction to assist an insurance company to recover Bitcoin that it had transferred in order to satisfy a malware ransom demand.\\nBackground\\nIn AA v Persons Unknown,\\n1\\nthe High Court has considered whether Bitcoin could be considered as property for the purposes of granting a proprietary injunction over Bitcoin. The Bitcoin in question was paid as part of a ransom following a cyberattack on a Canadian insurance company (the \"Company\"). The attack prevented the Company from accessing its IT systems that had been encrypted with malware. In order to regain access to the company\\'s IT systems, the hacker(s) demanded that the Company transfer 109.25 Bitcoins (equivalent to USD 950,000) to a specified account in exchange for the decryption software.\\nThe Company was insured against certain cyber-related incidents by an English insurance company (the \"Insurer\"). After the ransom had been paid, the Insurer hired consultants who tracked the Bitcoin payments to a specific address linked to the cryptoasset exchange Bitfinex. While some had been dissipated, 96 Bitcoins remained in the account. The Insurer therefore sought a proprietary injunction to recover the Bitcoins.\\nThe decision is significant not only for its conclusion that Bitcoin could be considered property under English law, but also due to the fact that in reaching its conclusion, the Court gave considerable weight to the recent UK Jurisdictional Task Force (\"UKJT\") Legal Statement on Cryptoassets and Smart Contracts, published in November 2019 (see update\\n).\\nDecision\\nIn order to grant the proprietary injunction, the fundamental question for the Court to consider was whether cryptoassets constituted a form of property capable of being the subject of such an injunction. While this issue has already been considered in two recent cases (with the Court treating cryptocurrencies as property in granting a worldwide freezing order\\n2\\nand an asset preservation order\\n3\\n), the Court had not previously considered the issue in depth.\\nAs a starting point, Bryan J noted that, \"prima facie there is a difficulty in treating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a form of property\" as English case law traditionally identifies property in two distinct categories. These include:\\na \\'thing in possession\\' (i.e. capable of being possessed in a tangible sense); or\\na \\'thing in action\\' (i.e. a right capable of being enforced by an action).\\nBryan J determined that cryptocurrencies cannot be \\'things in possession\\' as due to their virtual nature, they are intangible and cannot be possessed, nor can they be defined as \\'things in action\\' as they do not embody any right capable of being enforced by action.\\n4\\nIn seeking to resolve this difficulty, Bryan J referred to the UKJTs detailed analysis of the Courts treatment of novel kinds of intangible assets (including patents and EU carbon emissions allowance) and concluded that while a cryptoasset might not be a thing in action on a narrow definition, that did not mean it could not be treated as property.\\nBryan J concluded that the UKJT\\'s analysis was \"compelling\" and should be adopted by the Court.\\n5\\nFurther, as the Bitcoin met the four criteria set out in National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth\\n6\\n(being definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties, and having some degree of permanence), it was capable of being considered property. Bryan J therefore also applied the same reasoning as the landmark ruling in B2C2 v Quoine by the Singapore International Commercial Court (see update\\nhere\\n), which was one of the first decisions to apply contractual principles and trust law to a cryptocurrency trading case.\\nAccordingly, as the Court considered that all other requirements for a proprietary injunction were met (i.e. serious issue to be tried, balance of convenience in favour of granting relief, and damages not being an adequate remedy), Bryan J granted the injunction sought. The Court also ordered the controllers of the Bitfinex exchange to provide information regarding the identity and addresses of the hackers to ensure that the proprietary injunction could be properly policed. The Court further recognised the difficulties inherent in seeking to recover Bitcoin given its ease of transfer and, accordingly, the urgency of the application. It therefore authorised alternative service, including by email.\\nThis decision is significant as it provides detailed judicial reasoning for defining cryptoassets as property in a developing area of law. While the characteristics of cryptoassets can vary, this decision indicates that the English Courts are likely to find that established, tradeable cryptocurrencies can be treated as property. The decision therefore provides greater certainty to stakeholders in cryptoassets.\\nThis judgment is also noteworthy for the Court\\'s decision to allow the case to be heard in private. In reaching this decision, the Court noted the importance of the principle of open justice as stated in Cape Intermediate Holdings Ltd v Dring [2019] UKSC 38 (see update\\n), but held that \"publicity would defeat the object of the hearing\", as it would \"potentially tip off the persons unknown to enable them to dissipate the Bitcoins\".\\n7\\nBryan J also determined that the Company\\'s and the Insurer\\'s identity could be anonymised to prevent the possibilities of copycat cyberattacks.\\n', 'snippet': '...

Leveraging on the efficiency, security, and speed of blockchain technology, digital coins and tokens are penetrating every aspect of the financial world.\\nFinancial Loans\\nFrom credit cards to corporate bank loans, the extension of money from one entity to another is a huge market worldwide. This involves at least two parties. One is the lender, which offers the required amount at a determined interest, and the other is the receiver. The lending of money enables the receiver to use the money for a variety of purposes, from leveraging businesses to start ventures. But interest rates in the market also can go very high, becoming a barrier for people who would otherwise be able to use the money to expand their assets.\\nLeveraging through lending is a huge market, with estimates that two of the largest assets in the world, real estate and stock exchange to be standing globally at\\nUSD 217 trillion\\ndebt of USD 244 trillion\\n. This amounts to a debt to asset ratio of\\n80%\\n. On the other hand, the crypto market, with USD 200,000,000,000 has a\\nmere 2% debt to asset ratio\\n.\\nPawnHub: Expanding the Crypto Lending Market\\nA blockchain platform,\\nPawnHub.io\\n, is on a mission to capitalize on the largely ignored crypto lending sector. Based in Hong Kong, the fully licensed lending platform is in a perfect place to cater to the largest crypto markets in Asia, namely South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.\\nUsing blockchain itself, the platform uses the power of smart contracts to ensure the smoothness of its lending operations. Another feature of the smart contracts is that these digital contracts do not require an intermediary, creating a trustless environment for both the lender and the receiver of the loan. The owners of crypto assets have the security of retaining their ownership, while allowing liquidity of the assets on a near-immediate basis. Receivers of the loan also benefit by instant access to cryptocurrencies and enabling their diversity into assets such as real estate, automotive and other sectors.\\nThe license by the Hong Kong regulators also gives assurance to both parties. Compliant with financial laws,\\neliminates the fear of fraudulent activities. However, nothing is perfect. There is always a chance of a client losing their assets. The platform, in anticipation of any issues in the future in this regard, now offers\\ninsurance coverage of up to USD 100 million\\nto all of its clients, regardless of their location. The insurance comes with the partnership with CoinBase Custody.\\nThe combination of financial regulatory compliance and insurance coverage makes\\nthe perfect platform for lenders and loaners to access the expanding crypto loan market with peace of mind and security.\\nFor more information on how to access the crypto loan market, visit the', 'snippet': '... through the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and his creation of <b>Bitcoin</b>, digital currencies have changed the shape of traditional financial markets.', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-02-08T12:38:09', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PawnHub.png', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/hong-kongs-first-licensed-crypto-lending-platform-pawnhub-io-offers-100000000-insurance-coverage/'}}, {'id': '105057778963149362', 'title': 'London Startup Uses Artificial Intelligence for OTC Bitcoin Trades  The Merkle Hash', 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/london-startup-uses-artificial-intelligence-for-otc-bitcoin-trades/', 'description': 'The concept of replacing humans with AI remains controversial.A lot of people remain very wary of artificial intelligence, especially if money is involved.', 'body': \"For some reason, London-based AiX decided to experiment with this option.\\nIt now has a Bitcoin-USD trading solution based on artificial intelligence.\\nThis is part of the companys\\nto replace human brokers with AI in the very near future.\\nAlbeit this trial project is very limited, it marks an important milestone regardless.\\nThe artificial intelligence system communicates with traders through direct messages.\\nThis allows it to match clients looking to buy and sell.\\nBy effectively removing the middleman from the equation, the service is without cost and much faster.\\nIf this trial proves successful, support for traditional markets will follow soon.\\nThe concept of replacing humans with AI will remain controversial.\\nA lot of people remain very wary of artificial intelligence, especially if their money is on the line.\\nThat being said, this approach can unlock tremendous potential in OTC trading.\\nThe coming years will become very interesting for the financial sector as a whole.\\nA lot of will change between now and the end of the decade.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com\\nJdebunt\\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Today, more and more people are using this type of currency for all the benefits it provides.\\nIf you are seeing entering the crypto or virtual universe, or have recently made your first investment, you can explore the advantages of Bitcoin over your credit card. Online bank account or digital wallet that you are used to Crypto-currencies represents a financial evolution that manifests itself uniquely and tangibly compared to real money.\\nHere are some of the recent news.\\nRecent Survey Indicates 19% of French Citizens Are Ready To Make Payments In Crypto\\nA recent\\nstudy conducted\\nby the CSA institute discovered that a large percentage of the French population was open to the idea of paying for their purchases using cryptocurrencies. Interestingly the study found that a large portion of the population was well aware of virtual currencies.\\nIn total, 74% of the participants said that they had an idea of what digital currencies were all about. Out of that figure, 13% claimed to have a deep understanding of digital assets, and the other 61% even though they had an idea of what cryptos are, they didnt understand how they worked.\\nAmong those familiar with cryptocurrencies, 83% were men, and 79% were under the age of 35. Interestingly, 82% of those aware of virtual currencies were located in the Paris area.\\nThe study found out that one in five individuals were willing to make their purchases using cryptos.\\nHowever, despite being knowledgeable about them, only 5% of the respondents had used them to make payments. Cryptos are the least used mode of payment in France compared to other methods such as e-wallets and QR codes; however, its understandable given the lack of integration in everyday payment systems.\\nAs things stand, there is some work to be done before virtual currencies can be part of everyday life. This fact is supported by the fact that 30% of the French people considered crypto to be impractical and 69% believed it was reserved for people that are comfortable with new technologies.\\nWho Wants to Be My Partner?\\nAnother interesting news from France. A significant number of viewers should hear about Bitcoin and virtual currencies on channel M6. Ledgers boss\\nhas participated\\nin Who Wants to Be My Partner? a French adaptation of the hit show Dragons Den. The first episode was aired last week.\\nThis is not an unknown program that M6 producers have chosen to adapt. Created in 2001 in Japan under the name Money Tigers, the program format has been a real success around the world, especially its British (Dragons Den) and American (Shark Tank) versions.\\nThe French channel stands out from the names of the other versions, by choosing the nice Who wants to be my partner? The idea is to promote budding entrepreneurs who would present their projects to entrepreneurs who have been successful in France. The latter may or may not accept the proposal, but the platform is created for budding entrepreneurs to showcase their talent.\\nLedgers boss will be representing the crypto-cash industry. ric Larchevque, who is the creator and president of Ledger, has founded La Maison du Bitcoin (now called Coinhouse) in Paris.\\nCryptocurrency in the 2020s\\nNo one can predict the future 100% accurate. Especially in a market where anything can happen like cryptocurrencies. However, with Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the best way to predict the future is to create it.\\nOverall, Coinbases CEO\\nstated\\nthat in the next decade, we would see new advances in the blockchain. The blockchain will then solve the problem of scalability, improve security features, reach 1 billion users (from the number of 50 million at the beginning of the decade).\\nSimilarly, emerging markets will also expand their acceptance scale. At that time, the financial system will be broken. Startups will use cryptocurrency the way they are using the internet and machine learning today. Governments and organizations will not stand out of the game of cryptocurrencies.\\nCentral banks and institutions should accelerate investment in cryptocurrencies. Central banks will release their own official cryptocurrencies. The CEO of Coinbase also believes that a single currency will not necessarily back these digital currencies. They could be made up of a basket of virtual currencies, as is the case with Facebooks Libra project.\\nIn his view, this emphasis on the usefulness of cryptos will primarily take place in emerging territories where banks are less present, or which are experiencing a financial crisis.\\nMoney Laundering in Cryptocurrency\\nCriminals seek in every way to evade their practices; one of them is through money laundering with cryptocurrency.\\nThe virtual world is not out of this action because it has been identified that this practice is also reaching the virtual currencies. Though, there are technologies such as blockchains that help to curb these types of behavior.\\nAccording to an\\narticle published\\nin the 2020 Crypto Crime Report, content prepared by the consultancy Chainalysis, money laundering operations moved about US$ 2.8 billion in bitcoin currency that went through exchanges in 2019. Most of these amounts passed through the Binance and Huobi brokers, considered to be the worlds largest brokers.\\nIt is a large market to the extent that Chainalysis states that impossible to measure precisely. In this context, it is suggested in the article for cryptocurrency brokers to refine their KYC practices and policies and broaden them to understand better those who operate in the OTC market.\\nConclusion', 'snippet': '<b>Bitcoin</b>, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and its related?

The original conceptual difficulty with treating crypto-currency as true property is that English law traditionally views property as being of only two kinds, choses in possession and choses in action (para.55):\\nChoses in possession\\n: since crypto-currency is virtual, it cannot be possessed.\\nChoses in action (i.e. a legal right/claim)\\n: similarly, Bitcoin are not choses in action because they do not embody any right capable of being enforced by action.\\nHowever, the above formulation is derived from appellate authority which is almost 150 years old (1885)[\\n5\\n]; the Victorian Court of Appeal can be forgiven for having failed to foresee how the advent of crypto-currency would not fall neatly into their restrictive formulation.\\nHelpfully, UK jurists have not been idle and the trend of legal commentary has been to interpret the law as having moved on.

Online and mobile gaming is now the biggest sector of the gaming industry. This simply points to how accessibility is just really important to keep the business going.\\nThe rise of the use of cryptocurrencies only seems to positively affect the\\ngaming industry\\n. In particular, online casino gaming is what seems to be benefitting from this a lot. Cryptocurrency gambling has been on the rise in the past few years and it appears that it will continue to do so in the next few years.\\nCurrently, many online casinos like King Billy Casino already offer cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and other altcoins like Ethereum and Ripple as a mode of payment or payment option. You can check\\nClovrs review of King Billy Casino\\nto know which cryptos they accept. There are also online casinos that are purely dedicated to Bitcoin gaming.\\nMany online casino operators are focusing on luring in more crypto users to play their games and they do this by ensuring that crypto users get great deals and bonuses. Surely, this is something that beginners and expert online casino players are looking for.\\nNow, the use of\\ncryptocurrency as a mode of payment\\nis beneficial to both players and online gaming operators. For players, its mainly privacy and security that appeal to them as to why they prefer using cryptos.\\nWhen using Bitcoin or other altcoins, there is no need for its users to disclose their banking information whenever they need to make a transaction. Sure, this is somehow similar to how digital wallets like PayPal works. The difference, however, is that cryptos are powered by the blockchain technology.\\nBecause of the blockchain technology, transactions made with cryptocurrencies remain decentralized. This means that transactions are possible quicker and less of a hassle. This is especially how things are with online players who would need to make a deposit on gaming accounts that will be based offshore.\\nMany if not most of the banks are very strict when it comes to such transactions and sometimes, it would take a few days for the deposit and withdrawal to reflect on their accounts. Through the\\nuse of Bitcoin\\nor other cryptos, however, these problems can be avoided.\\nThe integration of the blockchain technology is what reassures the gamers when it comes to safely make transactions. Through this technology, transactions are less likely to be hacked or malicious. Fraudulent activities can easily be tracked and avoided.\\nBlockchain is just really a distributed ledger that works on the principle of nodes. It is temper-proof. Each transaction, no matter how small or big, can be traced because of this. This is why its just really impossible to manipulate the data. Tracing any malicious activity can be easily traced.\\nWhen it comes to how this is beneficial for operators, its also mainly convenience and saving up fees that would have gone to third-party service providers. Its much quicker for a Bitcoin casino to go live if the only mode of payment offered is cryptocurrencies.\\nTraditional online casinos would sometimes need to wait up to over a month or even 3 months before they can operate with all the payment options they choose to have. Meanwhile, it could only take as early as two weeks for a crypto-gaming site to go live.\\nKnow that online sites that process payments hire third-party providers or services to be able to process the payments. This means that these sites will have to pay for the services that they get. Meanwhile, running a site that only processes payment through cryptos no longer needs the help of third-party services.\\nOverall, the integration of both cryptocurrencies and\\nblockchain in gaming\\nis a win-win situation for all parties involved. Crypto-gaming is currently seen as the future of the gaming industry as more people are expected to own cryptos in the coming years.\\nThis is despite the fact that it has been a while since the value of cryptocurrencies have soared the way it had in 2017. Experts still see that the value of Bitcoin still has the chance to go as much as 20,000 US dollars once again in the future.\\nSurely, once this happens again, more people and businesses will once again show their interest in the use of cryptos. This would mean that there will be a bigger market for the online gaming industry. What will follow is that more gaming sites, apps, and the software will be accepting cryptos as a payment option.\\nImage(s): Shutterstock.com', 'snippet': '... many online casinos like King Billy Casino already offer cryptocurrencies like <b>Bitcoin</b> and other altcoins like Ethereum and Ripple as a mode of ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2020-02-01T12:25:52', 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_552107764.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'themerkle', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://themerkle.com/what-the-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-industries-are-giving-the-gaming-industry/'}}, {'id': '3155718684058047020', 'title': 'Chainalysis Report Confirms Criminal Transactions Represent 1.1% of all Crypto Activity  The Merkle Hash', 'url': 'https://themerkle.com/chainalysis-report-confirms-criminal-transactions-represent-1-1-of-all-crypto-activity/', 'description': 'With this rise in illicit crypto transactions, a very problematic situation ensues.That said, it is crucial to put everything into perspective.', 'body': \"No one will be surprised to learn that criminals still favor Bitcoin.

Of course, the timing of its introduction helped, giving humankind a promising alternative to the fundamentally broken fiat money at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Many people around the world were not aware of its existence and what it represented at that time, but Bitcoin eventually attracted well-deserved attention.\\nThis fabled digital asset ushered in the age of cryptocurrency. However, BTC remains far from mainstream adoption to this day. It has mesmerized technologists since day one. But it has also attracted\\nspeculators\\nwho are more interested in making bank than cementing its place as a reliable medium of exchange in the global economy.\\nBitcoin gained notoriety after the great crypto crash of 2018. It has steadily recovered since then, though. The virtual coin even surpassed the $9,000 mark recently, confirming that more and more investors are once again bullish.\\nThe first crypto is starting 2020 strong. Although it is premature to say that there will be no terrifying price fluctuations in the months ahead that might scare more people who wish to climb on the crypto bandwagon, it remains to be seen if a greater number of Americans will embrace it given the current trend in the crypto world. To see where BTC could be by the end of the year, let us look back a little bit to understand the context.\\nThe Money That Is Rarely Spent\\nThe folks at SpendMeNot say that Bitcoins are now accepted by\\nnumerous merchants in more than a dozen industries\\n. It is possible to buy an engagement ring, pay a cable bill, book a hotel, watch a movie, and donate to charity with the cryptocurrency.\\nIt is encouraging to see more and more businesses entering this uncharted territory. But how are consumers reacting to this new payment option? Quite passively.\\nIn 2019, most of the Bitcoins in circulation were traded, not spent. That came as no surprise since crypto exchanges sprung up like mushrooms. No one uses and understands digital assets more than traders, so it was natural for BTC not to replace cash last year.\\nThe few people who actually buy Bitcoins who do not call themselves pro traders, treat this digital currency like gold. Individuals, especially in areas plagued with economic and political turmoil, have used it as a wealth-preservation tool during times of uncertainty and instability.\\nThe past year had no shortage of examples, and Hong Kong was a shining one. The social unrest in the Chinese territory drove up the conversion rate of fiat into Bitcoin.\\nThen again, the notion that the cost of spending the coin was more expensive than a cup of joe was not widely accepted last year. Relatively, Bitcoins were spent more frequently last year due to the decline of their transaction fees.\\nObviously, the BTC community is still divided over whether the digital coin should be promoted as a currency or be traded like a hot commodity that it is. Neither side can stop the other, so the tug of war rages on with no end in sight.\\n10 Years of Meager Market Penetration\\n2019 was a big year for BTC in the United States. By December last year, the number of\\nworldwide reached over 6,000. The vast majority of them were installed in the US (75%). According to data, the country controls\\n66.2%\\n(Source: cryptoglobe.com) of these crypto machines globally.\\nThis exciting news means purchasing the digital coin is as easy as buying peppermint mocha at Starbucks in the streets of US cities like San Francisco or Tampa It is clear that the growing number of the so-called BTMs is an attempt to encourage the American public to join the Bitcoin revolution. Has it worked?\\nThe physical presence of these machines will likely have a positive impact on the marketing department in the long run. After all, It is hard to trust some form of money that is not tangible, which is why cash is still undefeated.\\nThe rapid increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, however, may not suffice to encourage ordinary American consumers to give any cryptocurrency a try. The fees these machines charge are rather prohibitive. The high exchange rates do not help promote usage too. The souls who would dare to fill their digital wallets are probably the same ones who have had digital currencies in the first place.\\nFurthermore, the high number of BTMs in the US might not have been influenced by rising demand. The most prolific manufacturer of Bitcoin ATMs in the world is California-based Genesis Coin. It probably was not a coincidence that the company wanted to give priority to its backyard.\\nIn 2018, some estimates showed that only 5% of the American population bought Bitcoins, and, according to CNBC,\\nanother 3%\\ninvested in some altcoins. If these statistics did not improve last year and if many adopters have yet to use digital coins as actual money, then the US enormous crypto market stays untapped. Americans have not been the biggest fans of fintech to begin with. But Bitcoin is unlikely to experience mainstream adoption without high market penetration in the US.\\nA Discouraging Approach to Crypto Taxation\\nBitcoin flew under the radar of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) until 2014. Prior to that year, it was used for transactions without any intervention from the US government. However, Uncle Sam realized that it could become a vehicle for money laundering in the black market. As a response, the IRS issued official guidance on cryptocurrency, which labeled BTC as property.\\nBeing recognized by the IRS was proof of the increasing importance of Bitcoin in American society. Sadly, the treatment of the coin imposed by tax authorities has stunted its growth.\\nThe US considers any activity that causes BTC to change hands a taxable event. If a Bitcoin was held for less than a year, its holder must pay income tax upon its transfer to another person or entity. But if held for more than 12 months, the rules for capital gains tax would apply. In other words, buying any goods or paying someone for a service with Bitcoin has to be reported to the IRS. If not, one can face harsh punishments.\\nFurthermore, Bitcoin losses can be used to offset taxes on better-performing investments under specific rules. If not used to reduce gains earned elsewhere, the losses can be deducted instead.\\nReporting all Bitcoin-related transactions is humanly possible. However, most American BTC holders have not been able to do so since diligent record-keeping is paramount to track them all and accurately file taxes.\\nThe IRS has threatened to file criminal complaints against\\nthousands of alleged tax evaders\\nwho have been avoiding paying taxes for years.
